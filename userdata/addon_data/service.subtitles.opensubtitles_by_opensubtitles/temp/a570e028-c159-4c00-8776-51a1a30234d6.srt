1
00:00:03,065 --> 00:00:04,638
- Get the wrapper.
- What wrapper?

2
00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:07,183
- The Tootsie Roll wrapper.
- What Tootsie Roll wrapper?

3
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:09,066
- The one at your feet.
- I don't see it.

4
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:10,720
- It's right there.
- Where?

5
00:00:10,808 --> 00:00:13,363
Marshall, stop arguing with me, my parents are watching.

6
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:18,074
Have you see these guys? They're hilarious.

7
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,035
- I got it, we can go.
- Why are you holding it like that?

8
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:22,583
Because when Lane left it here last night, it was a very different color.

9
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:23,736
Are you sure she's gonna want that back?

10
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:26,415
It's been left alone all night at a keg party. There's no getting it over that.

11
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:29,674
That backpack is permanently scarred. That backpack is Zelda Fitzgerald.

12
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:30,873
Well, Zelda's going home.

13
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:32,006
Okay.

14
00:00:32,904 --> 00:00:35,662
Your first cop-raided party. I am just so proud.

15
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:37,873
- Mom.
- I just wish I could've been there.

16
00:00:37,992 --> 00:00:39,978
- It was no big deal.
- Did they bring the paddywagon?

17
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:42,512
Yeah, but then we snuck out the backdoor of the speak-easy

18
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,838
and headed straight for the Algonquin.

19
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:45,549
- How was Benchley?
- Drunk again.

20
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:47,166
So tell me more about this party last night.

21
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,970
I mean, I know the end, but what happened in the middle?

22
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:53,091
Lane's band played, they were great, and then people just hung out and talked,

23
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,119
and then, there was some sort of fight, I guess.

24
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,418
The cops came, that's it.

25
00:00:57,398 --> 00:00:58,094
Hey, Luke.

26
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:01,192
I'm in bed.

27
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:04,602
I have ten more minutes to sleep. Not a lot of time in the grand scheme of things,

28
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:06,680
but still, ten minutes is ten minutes. You know what I mean.

29
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:08,268
- Sure, yeah.
- Ten minutes is great.

30
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,673
And then the phone rings, and it just rings and rings and rings and rings,

31
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:12,983
so I pick it up.

32
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:14,361
And then hopefully got your hearing checked.

33
00:01:14,457 --> 00:01:16,527
- Can I finish my story?
- I'm just saying, that's a lot of rings.

34
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:18,847
And on the other end of the phone is someone named John

35
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,940
who says he's Kyle's father,

36
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,080
and Kyle threw a party last night without permission.

37
00:01:24,192 --> 00:01:27,044
And two guys got into a fight and tore the place apart,

38
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:29,926
so John wants me to come down and take a look at the damage

39
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,999
and discuss some sort of solution to the problem of the damages.

40
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:35,851
Now, I don't know John, and I certainly don't know Kyle,

41
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,712
but I do know someone who would get into a fight at a party

42
00:01:38,826 --> 00:01:40,714
and leave the place completely trashed.

43
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:43,834
It's a wild guess, but I think his name rhymes with Tess.

44
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:47,177
So here I am, heading in there to talk to John about Kyle

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,884
and discuss what is to be done about the Hummel.

46
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,360
- The what?
- Exactly.

47
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:56,772
So let's get back to the party recap. Any little details you wanna tell Mommy?

48
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,173
- Jess and Dean got into the fight.
- Over you.

49
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:00,449
I was a contributing factor.

50
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:01,611
- Was anyone hurt?
- No.

51
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,419
And that's why the cops came and broke up the party?

52
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:07,054
So not only did you go to a cop-raided party but you started the raid?

53
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:09,241
This fence is broken because of you,

54
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,134
this crap is on the ground because of you.

55
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,128
What's your point?

56
00:02:12,736 --> 00:02:16,105
Did you ever know that you're my hero?

57
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:17,067
Oh my God!

58
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:20,739
You're everything I would like to be.

59
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:24,646
And I could fly higher than an eagle,

60
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,476
'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,074

62
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,931
Oh, these muffins, they're brilliant.

63
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,473
Tell us you sell your muffin mix.

64
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:29,372
Sookie, these people wanna throw roses at your feet.

65
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:30,541
And I will let them.

66
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:33,101
Listen, Sookie, Dennis and I and a bunch of us others

67
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:34,918
wondered if you offered cooking classes.

68
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,028
Cooking classes?

69
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:38,390
Some of the better B&B's have them on the itinerary.

70
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,140
Oh, of course they do.

71
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,358
So, we do, too.

72
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,704
We will be your disciples.

73
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,083
Oh my gosh, we're gonna have so much fun.

74
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,771
We'll start with some spreads and jams, and if there's time - desserts.

75
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:51,979
I have this chocolate balm... oh, but breads... and soups!

76
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,489
Sookie, hon, we don't have a kitchen.

77
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,584
- Oh, right.
- There's no kitchen?

78
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,969
Okay, not a problem. You'll all come to my house.

79
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,740
- Can't wait.
- Cheers.

80
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,867
Make a note - if the guests are gonna wear those robes downstairs,

81
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,772
we need to buy ones with thicker material.

82
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,006
Really.

83
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,765
Seeing the sunlight hit Dennis gave me a whole new respect for Peg.

84
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,874
Hey, listen, Jackson's up in Rochester today

85
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:15,864
helping his cousin rebuild his Nova.

86
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,625
He's not getting home 'til late, so you know what that makes me?

87
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,161
- Available.
- Like an intern.

88
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:21,984
What are you and Rory doing tonight?

89
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,037
I'm open. Rory's got plans with the grandparents.

90
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,651
I didn't know you guys were back in touch.

91
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:26,849
I'm not, Rory is.

92
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,140
Mmm, yeah.

93
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:31,186
Well, at least the family pressure's off you now. That's good, right?

94
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:34,077
I don't know. I mean, before this whole Friday night dinner thing,

95
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:36,675
I didn't see them regularly and we didn't talk regularly,

96
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,685
so it wasn't weird when I didn't see them or talk to them regularly.

97
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:40,633
You miss them.

98
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,063
No, I just feel like I'm not doing something I'm supposed to do. I feel guilty.

99
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:45,200
So what are you gonna do about it?

100
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:47,575
- I'm gonna hope it passes.
- Sounds healthy.

101
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:51,492
Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.

102
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:55,742
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

103
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:57,386
Blessed are they...

104
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:00,862
So, how are you? How were things last night?

105
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:02,864
You mean, after my drunken call to my mother?

106
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,406
Yeah. What happened when you got home?

107
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:05,523
I'm not sure.

108
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:06,781
What do you mean you're not sure?

109
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:10,853
Well, after I finished with my Farelly brothers' audition in the bushes -

110
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,942
- thank you for the hair-holding, by the way.
- Anytime.

111
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:15,384
Dave dropped me off at home. He wanted to come in,

112
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,184
but he's an only child and I saw no reason for his family line to end with him,

113
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:21,175
so I went in and he left.

114
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,284
- And?
- The place was dark.

115
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,153
- No Mrs. Kim?
- No Mrs. Kim.

116
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,006
- No Mrs. Kim.
- So, of course, I panicked.

117
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,239
What does this mean?

118
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:31,431
I mean, when I come home ten minutes late from bible study,

119
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:34,821
she has a cow. But I call her drunk, tell her I'm at a party,

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,318
I'm a drummer in a band, and I'm in love with a non-Korean...

121
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:38,724
I expected there to be backup -

122
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,826
aunts, uncles, cousins pulled out from villages I've never heard of,

123
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:43,905
- but nothing.
- I don't understand.

124
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,476
So I go upstairs to make sure everything's okay.

125
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,783
I look in her room and she's in bed asleep.

126
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:49,577
No.

127
00:05:49,747 --> 00:05:51,831
Then this morning, I get up, I go in the kitchen

128
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,518
where she's making breakfast and I say, "Good morning, Mama."

129
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:56,444
And?

130
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,916
She turns around, looks right at me and says,

131
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:00,668
"Good morning, Lane."

132
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:01,641
Really?

133
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:04,083
And those were the last words she's said to me all day.

134
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:05,682
So she's freezing you out?

135
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:08,041
No, it was more Stepford than cold.

136
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,562
You know, very calm, very serene.

137
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:12,823
Okay, well, let's think.

138
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:14,979
Maybe she didn't hear you.

139
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:16,777
I was drunk, I could've slurred.

140
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:20,254
Exactly. Maybe she thought you said you were at a smarty,

141
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:23,044
playing clock music, drinking fear,

142
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:25,824
and in love with Rave Smitchalsky.

143
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:29,255
- And how would that be better?
- It's much less clear.

144
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:32,414
- What is that smell?
- Your backpack.

145
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:34,735
Blessed are they which are pers...

146
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,009
Blessed are they who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,

147
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:40,248
for theirs are the Kingdom of Heaven.

148
00:06:40,352 --> 00:06:42,670
- You have to talk to her, Lane.
- I can't talk to her.

149
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,956
Well, what are you going to do?

150
00:06:44,032 --> 00:06:46,736
Well, first off, I volunteered to work this table for the next two months.

151
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,691
Plus, I told her I'd go to that Seventh Day Adventist college in Hartford

152
00:06:49,787 --> 00:06:51,369
- and live at home.
- Lane, no.

153
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:53,161
And I told Dave to forget about the prom.

154
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:55,191
- There's no way that's gonna happen.
- I'm sorry.

155
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:56,696
Don't be, it's my fault.

156
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:00,284
And utter every kind of evil against you falsely because of me, Amen.

157
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,697
Okay, let's go.

158
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:07,893
- Sorry, David.
- No problem, Archie.

159
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:18,867
- Excuse me, I'd like some ham.
- Be right back.

160
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:20,029
But I'd like some ham!

161
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,745
- Is this what I ordered?
- Yes.

162
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,375
- Know what you want yet?
- Oh, no, not yet.

163
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,625
- You know what might help?
- What?

164
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:28,888
- Opening the menu.
- Yes, thank you for the tip.

165
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:32,083
- I need ham.
- No ham.

166
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:34,234
- We got a shipment of ham yesterday.
- No ham.

167
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,604
Caesar, there's a lady over there that has been saying she wants ham

168
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,632
for the last twenty minutes and if I go back there empty handed,

169
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:41,145
there's a fifty-fifty chance that she will eat me.

170
00:07:41,402 --> 00:07:42,261
No ham.

171
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:44,694
Then sew some bacon together 'cause that woman is getting ham.

172
00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:49,721
Excuse me, I don't think this is what I... Thank you.

173
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:51,915
Who ordered this? Look in front of you.

174
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:54,167
If there is nothing there and there should be, then this is yours.

175
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,312
Oh, here.

176
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,937
- Well?
- What?

177
00:08:00,168 --> 00:08:02,796
- You know what you want yet?
- I'll just have more coffee.

178
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,411
More coffee coming up. Glad to make your dining dreams come true.

179
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:11,264
"Oh, who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew.

180
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,821
Cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two, the candy man.

181
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,658
Oh, the candy man can!"

182
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:22,318
Yes, that's right, the candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love

183
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:25,687
and makes the world taste good, and I, ladies and gentlemen,

184
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:29,160
am the candy man. Your candy man.

185
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:32,217
I'm mixing it with love and making Stars Hollow taste good.

186
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:34,214
- Move.
- In a second Jess.

187
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,300
Give him a taffy. I come to announce to one and all

188
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,362
that the day we all thought would never get here has arrived.

189
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:42,713
- Arbor Day?
- No.

190
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:43,982
- The Day of Reckoning?
- No

191
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,551
- The day the music died?
- Kirk.

192
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:46,977
- Give me a taffy.
- What?

193
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,929
I've got a million of 'em. Give me a taffy!

194
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,216
As I was saying, the big day has arrived.

195
00:08:52,303 --> 00:08:57,526
The opening of Taylor's Old Fashioned Soda Shoppe and Candy Store!

196
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:03,164
Tomorrow from noon to six, there will be fun, balloons, ice cream,

197
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:06,660
and old fashioned penny candy for just one dollar a piece.

198
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:08,816
Come at noon, stay all day...

199
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,279
Where the hell have you been? The place is a freaking zoo.

200
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,074
Every table's full and I've got Sammy Davis Jr. here thinking it's the Desert Inn.

201
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:15,990
I had to run an errand.

202
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,887
Everybody's complaining, we're out of ham,

203
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,728
Caesar's suddenly decided to join the Slow Food Movement,

204
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:23,590
and I've got a guy who's moved in at a table for four.

205
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:26,622
He just sits, making it impossible for me to turn over that table,

206
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:29,387
and if I can't turn over that table, then that cuts way back on my tips.

207
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:31,941
- I'm sorry, don't you mean my tips?
- What?

208
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:33,656
- You know where I was this morning?
- No.

209
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:36,058
I was at Kyle's. His parents called me this morning.

210
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,653
Oh, yeah?

211
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,335
Seems a little party you went to last night got a little Animal House, huh?

212
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,170
Dean started it.

213
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,044
Oh, you're not really gonna use that one, are you?

214
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,968
He did. He sucker punched me and I was just defending myself.

215
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:47,697
Oh, apparently you defended yourself all the way through the house

216
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,892
and out into the front yard. You defended yourself with a chair that is now broken.

217
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:53,002
You defended yourself with a coffee table.

218
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:55,029
You defended yourself with an ottoman.

219
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:55,931
I don't need a recap.

220
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,882
Do you have any idea how much damage you caused?

221
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,406
- Dean caused it, too.
- The place was trashed.

222
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:01,747
Dean trashed it, too.

223
00:10:03,222 --> 00:10:06,069
- Are you trying to kill me?
- Nope, it'll just be a perk.

224
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,415
Okay, well, here's the deal.

225
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:11,302
From now on, every cent that you make here goes toward paying them back.

226
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:13,935
- Hey, what about...
- Dean's paying them back also.

227
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:14,928
How do you know?

228
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:17,298
Because he was at Kyle's house when I got there.

229
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:18,097
You're kidding me.

230
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:20,605
He had already worked out a financial agreement

231
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,140
with the parents and was helping them put a fence back up.

232
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,803
Man, he's gonna make some woman a fine doormat someday.

233
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:27,211
You are making good on this, Jess.

234
00:10:27,313 --> 00:10:28,839
I have to get more coffee out of the store room.

235
00:10:28,947 --> 00:10:32,096
Every cent is getting paid back. I never want those people calling me again.

236
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:45,264
Hey, you left your wallet! Hey!

237
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,883
Okay, here's the problem.

238
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,114
Every single one of my skirts is either too long or too short

239
00:10:58,227 --> 00:10:59,717
for this season's acceptable lengths.

240
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,395
Which means I either have to alter or shop.

241
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:03,522
To be or not to be.

242
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:05,631
Just wait 'til you hear what InStyle thinks of you, young lady.

243
00:11:05,892 --> 00:11:07,014
What time are you getting home tonight?

244
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,717
We have to go over the special graduation edition of the Franklin,

245
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:11,836
and of course we're completely behind, partly because Paris

246
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:14,833
can't let anything go to print unless she's proofed it a million times.

247
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:18,212
- Can you say crazy anal micromanager?
- Not five times fast.

248
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,060
- I'll be home by ten.
- That's all I needed to know.

249
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:21,928
- I forgot my notes.
- I put them in your bedroom.

250
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,228
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

251
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:39,847
Lorelai?

252
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:41,141
Yup, it's me.

253
00:11:43,271 --> 00:11:45,293
- So, how are you?
- I'm fine.

254
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,747
Good. How's Dad?

255
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:48,428
- He's fine.
- Also good.

256
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:50,051
May I speak with Rory please?

257
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:51,941
- No, you can't speak with Rory.
- Why not?

258
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,768
- Because I called you.
- So what?

259
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:56,094
You don't get to request a switch when a person calls you.

260
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:57,864
I'm sure she's standing right there.

261
00:11:57,986 --> 00:12:00,614
Not the point. If you wanna talk to Rory, you have to call.

262
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:02,646
Then when I answer the phone, you can ask for Rory.

263
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:05,643
But you didn't call, I called, so you cannot ask for Rory.

264
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:07,280
What do you want, Lorelai?

265
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:09,907
I just wanted to see how you were. I haven't seen you for awhile.

266
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:12,360
- Your choice.
- No, your choice, Mom.

267
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:14,633
You're the one who called off Friday night dinners.

268
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,132
No, I'm the one who called off the obligation for Friday night dinners.

269
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:20,152
You're the one who called off... You know what, I didn't call to argue.

270
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:21,418
Fine, let's not argue.

271
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:22,999
Come on, Mom, this is silly.

272
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:27,111
I mean, think back to before the whole Friday night dinner thing.

273
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:28,571
We still had a relationship.

274
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:30,685
You mean the one where I would trick you into calling me

275
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,528
by leaving a message on your answering machine

276
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,331
saying I had something important to tell you,

277
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:37,055
but I wouldn't include the details so you had no choice but to call me.

278
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:38,616
Yes.

279
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,253
And then when you did call, we'd talk about the weather,

280
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:43,973
you'd ask about the DAR, and then you'd put Rory on the phone,

281
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,666
- even when she was too young to talk.
- It was not always like that.

282
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,187
It was always like that.

283
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,378
Very well. The weather's fine, the DAR is staging a luncheon at the library next week.

284
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,351
You already said I couldn't talk to Rory, so there,

285
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:58,095
- I think you've fulfilled your obligation.
- Okay, Mom, fine.

286
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,738
- Have a nice day.
- Same to you.

287
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:06,118
It's for you!

288
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,815
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- The issue is a disaster.

289
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:12,016
It's our last issue of the Franklin and it's a complete disaster.

290
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,030
I'm sure it's not that bad.

291
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:15,488
And that's why you won't need to Botox your frown lines on your nineteenth birthday.

292
00:13:15,555 --> 00:13:18,109
Not that picture, no, put it down. Put it down now!

293
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:20,460
- How's it coming?
- Very frustrating.

294
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:22,355
We just can't seem to get exactly the right combination.

295
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:25,642
All right. How about blue dress, blonde guy, black limo? Works best for me.

296
00:13:25,801 --> 00:13:28,473
Yes, however, green dress, red-haired guy, white limo works best for me.

297
00:13:28,555 --> 00:13:31,008
White limo with blonde guy totally doesn't work. It's too washed up.

298
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:33,414
I'm assuming this conversation veered off of the cover page placement?

299
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:35,709
How about black-haired guy, green dress and tan limo?

300
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,556
- Tan limo?
- Good neutral backdrop.

301
00:13:37,745 --> 00:13:40,645
Well, this opens up a whole new set of options. Bring the golf team back in.

302
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,399
Okay, why don't I just get these pesky Franklin articles out of your way.

303
00:13:43,471 --> 00:13:44,780
- There we go.
- What are you doing?

304
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,102
- I am working on the front page placement.
- What are they doing?

305
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,483
- Staying true to who they are.
- Look, prom is once.

306
00:13:49,584 --> 00:13:51,581
It happens, it's photographed, and then it's there forever.

307
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:52,739
Planning is essential.

308
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,986
By the way, Paris, we left a space for you in the limo.

309
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,301
However, we're gonna need the color of your dress.

310
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:57,172
And a picture of Jamie.

311
00:13:57,258 --> 00:13:59,107
And the amount of flexibility that you have with the color of your dress.

312
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,881
And with Jamie.

313
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,792
Thank you, but we've already made our plans for prom night.

314
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,947
Jamie hired a private car to drive us to the prom.

315
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:06,982
We'll go in, take the picture, depending on the level of lameness, dance.

316
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:10,070
Then he's taking me to dinner at Antoine's, followed by a helicopter ride to join

317
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:11,965
his parents out in Martha's Vineyard for the weekend.

318
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:14,361
- What color's the helicopter?
- As you were.

319
00:14:15,114 --> 00:14:17,141
So, have you figured out your plans for prom night yet?

320
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:19,972
Oh, no, but Stars Hollow is a much more casual kind of a prom.

321
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:22,251
- Less Cinderella, more Footloose.
- Still a prom.

322
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:23,304
It is still a prom.

323
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:24,677
I can't wait.

324
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:33,429
It's my own fault. I poked a slumbering bear with a stick.

325
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:37,991
I reached out and initiated contact with Emily Gilmore. I get what I deserve.

326
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:40,403
- You're a bad girl.
- You know what really stinks?

327
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:43,153
They're having Rory over tonight for a movie night.

328
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,883
Movie night? That's your thing with her.

329
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,497
Exactly. What's next?

330
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:50,239
"Stay home and dance around in your underwear to the Monkees' greatest hits" night?

331
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:51,775
I wouldn't put it past them to steal that, too.

332
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:52,712
What's going on?

333
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,808
- Oh my God.
- Fran.

334
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:59,118
- Poor thing.
- I don't believe it.

335
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,560
- Such a great lady.
- Great lady.

336
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:04,170
Eighty-three on her last birthday.

337
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:07,049
- A good long life.
- We should all be so lucky.

338
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:08,647
- I'm gonna miss her.
- Me, too.

339
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:14,180
- So...
- Yeah?

340
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:17,182
I guess this'll put that old inn of hers on the market.

341
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:20,546
Right. I mean, she wanted to keep it as long as she was alive, and now...

342
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:23,495
- Oh my God.
- What?

343
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:26,813
You don't think that because we wanted the property so much, we killed Fran.

344
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:28,800
- What?
- Through the power of our minds.

345
00:15:28,907 --> 00:15:31,135
No, no, we wished for the property, not this!

346
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:32,620
Yeah, but you never know with karma.

347
00:15:32,784 --> 00:15:35,457
- Look, we loved Fran, right?
- Yes, we did.

348
00:15:35,528 --> 00:15:37,847
And whether or not we get the Dragonfly Inn has nothing to do

349
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,384
with her dying right now.

350
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,186
Right... sort of.

351
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:42,994
Besides, we don't know what's happening with the inn.

352
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:44,820
- Fran has no heirs.
- You never know.

353
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:47,627
Some long lost gold-toothed cousin could come out of the woodwork,

354
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:51,416
inherit it and turn it into a beauty salon or law offices.

355
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:52,573
Not our Dragonfly!

356
00:15:52,758 --> 00:15:55,196
The point is, if we are meant to have the Dragonfly Inn,

357
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:57,746
- then we are meant to have it.
- Right. Like Doris Day.

358
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:59,009
- Que sera.
- Sera.

359
00:15:59,369 --> 00:16:01,816
Let's focus on Fran and how much we loved her.

360
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,049
- Not think about the inn at all.
- Okay.

361
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:06,864
You're thinking about it.

362
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:08,477
Just about where to put the woodburning oven.

363
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,458
We'll put it in the apartment that we're sharing in hell.

364
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:13,045
- Let's buy flowers.
- Yeah, lots and lots of flowers.

365
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:18,615
This is a really nice chair.

366
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:22,116
- Is it old?
- Old enough.

367
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:25,174
Well, it's really nice. I mean, the back is very sturdy

368
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,964
and the legs are all the same length and the wood looks like

369
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:32,122
it was a tree at some point, which is good for wood, 'cause it was.

370
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:33,945
Could you get that please?

371
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:34,949
Yes, Mama.

372
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,883
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to see your mother.

373
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,090
- What?
- Excuse me.

374
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:44,196
Dave, Dave, wait!

375
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,216
Excuse me, Mrs. Kim, I need to speak with you.

376
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,126
I'm busy, David.

377
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,646
A few weeks ago you told me that Lane had a crush on me.

378
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:53,643
Well, I have a crush on her, too.

379
00:16:53,735 --> 00:16:56,372
Now, I know you have very strict rules about dating and boys,

380
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:58,922
but I just want you to know that I'm a good person.

381
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,754
I don't smoke, I don't drink, I've never gotten a ticket,

382
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:04,441
I'm healthy, I take care of myself, I floss.

383
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:07,206
I never watch more than 30 minutes of television a night partly

384
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,580
because I think it's a waste of time and partly because there's nothing on.

385
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,218
I respect my parents, I do well in school,

386
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:15,681
I never play video games in case they do someday prove

387
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:17,668
that playing them can turn you into a serial killer.

388
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,497
I don't drink coffee. I hate soda because the carbonation freaks me out.

389
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:24,252
I'm happy to give up meat if you feel strongly about it.

390
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:25,639
I don't mind wearing a tie.

391
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:28,379
I enjoy playing those hymns on my guitar,

392
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:31,840
and I really, really want to take your daughter to the prom.

393
00:17:37,586 --> 00:17:38,229
Mrs. Kim?

394
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,805
Please don't make me repeat that list again.

395
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,277
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,

396
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,238
but still remember what the Lord hath done.

397
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,860
Okay, thank you.

398
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:05,531
- Did you hear what she said?
- Yes, I did.

399
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:06,813
- What did it mean?
- I don't know.

400
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:08,952
- Was it a yes, was it a no?
- I'm not sure.

401
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,559
Well, it's gotta be from the bible, right? So I'll just go home, do some research,

402
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,022
look on the Internet, see what I can find. I'll call you when I know something.

403
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,082
Okay.

404
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:23,048
I'm so writing him a song tonight.

405
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,614
Left your wallet in the diner.

406
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,845
Oh, wow, did I?

407
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:44,932
Look at that. I guess I did. Thanks for bringing it back.

408
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,727
No problem.

409
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:48,389
You know, I really like this driver's license picture, too,

410
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,458
so you could imagine what a drag it would be to have to replace it.

411
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:51,481
So what are you doing here, Jimmy?

412
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:53,975
- Just passing through.
- Passing through from where?

413
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:56,085
- California.
- California?

414
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:58,845
Yeah, I've been there for a few years now, seems to be working out.

415
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,687
- Well, glad to hear it.
- Yeah.

416
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:04,175
- So what are you doing here, Jimmy?
- Nothing, really, just...

417
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,268
- He hasn't missed you.
- I'm sure that he hasn't.

418
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,537
- Never says a word about you.
- I wouldn't expect he would.

419
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:10,350
Do you know why he doesn't miss you, Jimmy?

420
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:13,724
Because you're a loser and nobody missed a loser.

421
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:15,158
It's been seventeen years, Luke.

422
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,246
Oh, you remember how long it's been. I am impressed.

423
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:18,639
Yeah, well, I always could count.

424
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,191
And your list of attributes ends there.

425
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,330
Okay, so I guess we're not playing nice anymore.

426
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:26,151
You know, the last time I saw you is right after Liz gave birth.

427
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:28,430
You were gonna go out and buy some diapers

428
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:30,350
and meet us back at the apartment. Remember that?

429
00:19:30,441 --> 00:19:30,846
Yes.

430
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,083
You went out, but you never came back.

431
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,993
A lot of time has passed and a lot of things have changed.

432
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,779
Really, like what things? You?

433
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:39,766
Yes, me. Maybe. Why not?

434
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,773
Oh, come on, you never called before. Why now?

435
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,273
- What do you want, you need money?
- What?

436
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,008
- 'Cause he doesn't have any.
- I don't need money.

437
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,888
- I don't have any either.
- I don't need money.

438
00:19:47,016 --> 00:19:48,594
So the look is a choice?

439
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,747
No, I just wanted to... I don't know, see him.

440
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,151
- Why now?
- I don't know,

441
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,751
I just thought it was time. You don't think it was time?

442
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,604
You really want my opinion on this subject?

443
00:19:57,717 --> 00:19:59,786
- Luke, give me a break.
- Give you a break?

444
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,253
I am trying to keep this kid from falling off the face of the Earth.

445
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:04,384
I'm trying to get him through school. I'm trying to give him a future.

446
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:07,549
And I gotta be totally honest with you, Jimmy - I am not doing too well.

447
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:07,985
No?

448
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:12,048
No, and the last thing he needs is a special appearance by his father

449
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,240
who can't be here for any good reason.

450
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:17,210
There's no evil plan here. I have a job, a life.

451
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:19,213
- I just thought I'd come and...
- What? Say hello,

452
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,266
- see if he looks like you? Then what?
- Well...

453
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:22,403
- What?
- I don't know!

454
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,429
Okay, well, while you're figuring it out, let me plant this little thought in your head -

455
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:29,152
you do or say anything to upset Jess and make it harder for me

456
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:32,043
to keep him on the right path, I'm gonna put your head through a wall.

457
00:20:32,157 --> 00:20:35,650
Any wall, you can pick the wall, but it's gonna be a wall, okay?

458
00:20:38,332 --> 00:20:39,935
I just wanted to see him.

459
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:43,667
Well, you saw him. Now get outta here.

460
00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:53,199
You know, Fran was one of the first people I met when we moved here.

461
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:53,896
I know.

462
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:55,898
The first day here, I stopped in...

463
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:57,454
And asked her for directions to the inn.

464
00:20:57,598 --> 00:21:01,632
Yeah. She was so sweet. And oh my God, she loved you.

465
00:21:01,873 --> 00:21:04,807
I didn't think she was gonna let me leave the bakery with you.

466
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:08,186
She just kept giving you cookies in a shameless attempt

467
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:10,308
to buy your affections away from me. And let me tell you,

468
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,361
for a couple weeks, it worked. For two weeks, you just kept staring at me like,

469
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,773
"You're the lady who took me away from the cookies. I'm gonna kill you."

470
00:21:16,922 --> 00:21:19,194
Mom, can I just meet you at the church?

471
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,765
Why, what are you planning? Is it finally payback time?

472
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:23,932
I just need to stop in at Doose's and get something.

473
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:26,327
- Kleenex, we'll need Kleenex.
- I'll come with you.

474
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:27,649
Well...

475
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:32,829
Patty...

476
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:37,325
Now it all starts.

477
00:21:37,628 --> 00:21:38,560
What all starts, honey?

478
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,434
First Fran, then the rest of us.

479
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,761
Patty, it's not the plague. It was just her time.

480
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,624
- I can't go.
- Yes, you can. Come on.

481
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:47,863
No, just leave me.

482
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:50,444
- I'm gonna get her to the church.
- I'll meet you there.

483
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,811
Come on, let's go.

484
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:57,950
You know, it's times like these that you realize

485
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,079
what is truly important in your life.

486
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,350
I'm so glad I had all that sex.

487
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:07,690
Hurry, honey.

488
00:23:20,454 --> 00:23:21,355
What are you looking at?

489
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,353
Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed.

490
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:34,361
Thank you for coming, the grand opening has been postponed.

491
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:54,315
Welcome all. The large number of people here today is a testament

492
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:57,622
to how much Fran Weston has touched each and every one of us.

493
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,086
We'd like to start by inviting Marjorie Rogers,

494
00:24:00,358 --> 00:24:02,702
Fran's close friend, to share a few words with us.

495
00:24:08,237 --> 00:24:11,182
In 1955, Fran opened Weston's Bakery.

496
00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:13,645
Back then, she was the new kid on the block,

497
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:19,220
and soon thereafter, she hired me, a mother of three rugrats and a husband overseas,

498
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,174
and we became best friends. Still are.

499
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:23,203
That's so sweet.

500
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:25,170
You think we'll still be friends when we're dead?

501
00:24:25,324 --> 00:24:26,158
I will if you will.

502
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,313
Fran was and is Stars Hollow.

503
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:32,373
And to ensure that her love and spirit continue,

504
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:36,087
Weston's Bakery will remain open and run by those

505
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:38,529
who have Fran's heart in their hearts.

506
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,156
Of course, Fran's family has been here long before even Fran.

507
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:48,472
They opened the Dragonfly Inn back in 1893.

508
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:54,689
The Dragonfly Inn was once regarded as the Violet Lady, the premiere inn in all of ...

509
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:55,636
What'd she say?

510
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,756
I heard "premiere inn" then squat.

511
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,016
Is she still talking about the inn?

512
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:02,815
I don't know.

513
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:10,131
Inn ... ortant role... ing... it's special... all who...

514
00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:11,319
She said "inn."

515
00:25:11,862 --> 00:25:13,306
And "ortant" and "ing."

516
00:25:14,576 --> 00:25:18,313
...set... World War...

517
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:19,471
She said World War.

518
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:20,878
One or two? Where are we, where are we?

519
00:25:21,648 --> 00:25:22,400
Fran...

520
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,453
- She's pointing to somebody.
- Yeah, it's a man in a suit.

521
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:29,702
- Does he have a gold tooth?
- I don't know.

522
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,308
- You guys, people are turning.
- ...to you all.

523
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:36,413
- Did she say who gets the inn?
- I don't know.

524
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,044
Thank you, Marjorie.

525
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:51,120
And now, I'd like to point out that the time is twelve p.m.,

526
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:55,103
the time Fran would normally be opening her doors on Sunday after church,

527
00:25:55,282 --> 00:25:58,570
welcoming us to join her in friendship at Weston's Bakery.

528
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,906
So, if we may at this time all bow our heads for a minute of silence

529
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:05,881
to mark the passing of the soul and our dear departed friend.

530
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:14,535
No, no, the grand opening is canceled!

531
00:26:15,403 --> 00:26:19,615
Sorry, folks. Stop, it is canceled...

532
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:22,220
Canceled!

533
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:26,008
As we close, I'd like to honor a special request Fran had,

534
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:28,836
and that is to take one final stroll around the Town Square

535
00:26:28,944 --> 00:26:30,791
before going to her final resting place.

536
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:34,504
All those who would like to participate, please assemble outside.

537
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,782
Walking with dead people not my thing. Let's go.

538
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:40,632
- Where's Sookie?
- Just giving our condolences.

539
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:42,159
And asking what you missed when the mike cut out?

540
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,356
And giving our condolences.

541
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:45,611
The man in the suit's name is Brink.

542
00:26:45,677 --> 00:26:47,659
He's a lawyer and he's here to get Fran's affairs in order.

543
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:48,728
Do you think we can talk to him?

544
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:50,171
Yes, but Lorelai, you have to get back to the inn

545
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:53,085
and I've got those B&B'ers waiting at my home to learn how to make jam.

546
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,314
Okay, well, let's get him now.

547
00:26:54,626 --> 00:26:56,870
I think our window of opportunity just slammed shut.

548
00:26:58,534 --> 00:26:59,849
- Great.
- Now what?

549
00:27:00,023 --> 00:27:03,024
We very respectfully hover in his vicinity until the walk is over...

550
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:06,142
Then we will politely ask him to get in touch with us.

551
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:06,711
Yes.

552
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:09,497
- Coming?
- No, you guys go ahead.

553
00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:11,718
I'll be in the back of the line so that when the earth opens up

554
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:13,660
and swallows you whole, I'll be here to tell a story.

555
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:14,263
Okay.

556
00:27:17,668 --> 00:27:19,143
Hey, Rory.

557
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:20,858
Oh, hey. You were in there?

558
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:23,506
Yeah. I got here late so I kind of just hung in the back.

559
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:24,677
It was nice of you to come.

560
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:26,947
- Well, she was a nice lady.
- Yeah, she was.

561
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:31,247
Listen, can I talk to you for a sec? We'll catch up, I promise.

562
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,517
- Sure.
- Good.

563
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:35,073
- Okay...
- What?

564
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:36,977
Come on.

565
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:39,506
Dean, what are you doing?

566
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:40,561
Okay.

567
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:44,047
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

568
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:46,782
I asked Lindsay to marry me.

569
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,724
- You... you...
- And she said yes.

570
00:27:51,012 --> 00:27:53,076
- She... she...
- So what do you think?

571
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:55,144
- I... I...
- I know, who woulda thought?

572
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:59,829
I mean, it's weird, but Lindsay's amazing and I asked and she said yes, so...

573
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:01,472
I'm getting married.

574
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:04,165
Say something.

575
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:05,789
Why?

576
00:28:06,695 --> 00:28:07,299
What?

577
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,286
No, I don't mean why, I mean, why now?

578
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:10,622
Why not now?

579
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:12,383
Well, you're eighteen, first of all.

580
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,612
- So?
- So, you're young.

581
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:16,107
I mean, you haven't even gone to college yet.

582
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:18,195
Oh my God, you are still going to college, aren't you?

583
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:20,049
Yes, Rory, I'm still going to college.

584
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:22,189
- Well, how...
- Lindsay's gonna go with me.

585
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:24,606
But Dean, you're going to be studying and taking classes,

586
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:25,809
you need to focus on that.

587
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:27,530
I mean, you don't even know what you wanna do yet.

588
00:28:27,677 --> 00:28:30,070
And you guys haven't even been going out for that long.

589
00:28:30,178 --> 00:28:32,410
I mean, why don't you just date for awhile? Dating's fun.

590
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:33,689
Thank you.

591
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:34,857
For what?

592
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:37,421
For your deep heartfelt congratulations.

593
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,793
You just... you took me by surprise.

594
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:43,306
So what? It's good news, you can't just be happy for me?

595
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:45,021
I can. I am. I just...

596
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,832
You know what, I'm sorry if you have a crappy relationship with Jess.

597
00:28:47,965 --> 00:28:48,943
Hey, that has...

598
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:51,104
And I'm sorry if he treats you like dirt and everyone hates him,

599
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,282
but that was your choice.

600
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,703
I have a great girlfriend and I am really happy,

601
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,705
and when you dumped me for that jackass, I thought I'd never be happy again.

602
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,250
Jess does not treat me like dirt.

603
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,018
Whatever.

604
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,111
I just wanted you to hear it from me before it got out.

605
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,026
Now you know, so...

606
00:29:06,096 --> 00:29:07,080
have a nice life.

607
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:10,713
Jess does not treat me like dirt!

608
00:29:14,677 --> 00:29:16,081
Mama, do you need any help?

609
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:17,602
No, thank you.

610
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:23,182
- I could get out the soy scones.
- If you like.

611
00:29:25,732 --> 00:29:26,285
Tofutter?

612
00:29:27,073 --> 00:29:27,483
Fine.

613
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:35,856
Mama, I'm really sorry about the other night. I did everything wrong,

614
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:38,948
everything you taught me not to do. I lied to you, I let you down.

615
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,652
I never intended to do that and I don't know how to fix it,

616
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:45,025
but I'm going to try my hardest because I am so, so sorry.

617
00:29:48,062 --> 00:29:49,967
I'll be upstairs if you need me. I'm gonna go in my room,

618
00:29:50,274 --> 00:29:52,680
gonna iron my dress for church and I'm gonna think about what I've done.

619
00:30:04,627 --> 00:30:06,567
I stayed up all night.

620
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:09,041
I read the entire bible cover to cover.

621
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,375
- I don't know what it means.
- David.

622
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:14,243
You have to tell me what it means. Is it yes, is it no?

623
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:16,224
I can't feel my right elbow anymore.

624
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:19,133
- I don't even know why, but I can't.
- David.

625
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,582
Please, just tell me.

626
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:23,633
- I'm so tired.
- It's not from the bible.

627
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:26,680
- What?
- It's Shakespeare, Henry VI.

628
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,471
I like to goof off now and then, too, you know.

629
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:29,917
Shakespeare.

630
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,855
That is a very difficult this to do, reading the bible in one night.

631
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:34,775
I myself have only done it three times.

632
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,919
You need great determination and excellent light.

633
00:30:38,354 --> 00:30:39,782
I'm very impressed.

634
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:45,655
- All right.
- All right what?

635
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,785
You can go to the prom, but you cannot get married.

636
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:49,766
- That seems fair to me.
- And me!

637
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:53,238
The person who is going upstairs to think about what she's done.

638
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:57,622
Lane is grounded until the prom and for two months after.

639
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,171
You may call her on the phone every other day

640
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,993
for ten minutes and that is all. Understand?

641
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:04,729
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mrs. Kim.

642
00:31:09,561 --> 00:31:10,473
Lane!

643
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,877
Thinking about what I've done!

644
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:21,826
So apparently we're all supposed to walk like Fran.

645
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:22,768
It's almost four.

646
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:26,526
Okay, I've gotta take some initiative here.

647
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,463
What are you doing?

648
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:30,735
Just focus on the ground and look lost in grief.

649
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:37,391
It was a nice service.

650
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:38,988
- Yes.
- Yes.

651
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,491
And this is a really nice idea, the walk around the square.

652
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,488
Oh, yeah, a great idea.

653
00:31:44,878 --> 00:31:49,890
I may steal it when I die. You know, ask them to walk me around a benefit counter.

654
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,215
Might freak out the makeover girls, but it's...

655
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,427
- It's nice.
- Really nice.

656
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,244
So listen, my name is Lorelai Gilmore

657
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:01,748
and this is Sookie St. James.

658
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:04,657
I know this isn't exactly the best time for this,

659
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,684
but we were wondering if you had any idea

660
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,672
what's going to happen with the Dragonfly.

661
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:09,757
Because we want it!

662
00:32:10,315 --> 00:32:12,676
Sookie and I actually talked to Fran about buying it once.

663
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:14,564
We work in the Independence Inn now.

664
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:15,855
The one that burned down?

665
00:32:16,153 --> 00:32:18,942
Yes, but that was just an accident. It was a bad wire.

666
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:20,488
A bad, bad wire.

667
00:32:20,602 --> 00:32:23,443
It could've happened to anyone and should in no way reflect our inn-running abilities.

668
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:26,618
Yes, do you think we could discuss this a little later?

669
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,978
This is a little heavy and I sort of need to focus.

670
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,770
Oh, let me help you here.

671
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:34,032
Ooh, wow, for a little woman... Sookie, will you just...

672
00:32:34,123 --> 00:32:35,813
Oh, right.

673
00:32:36,511 --> 00:32:40,396
Anyway, we were just wondering, did she leave the Dragonfly to anyone?

674
00:32:40,955 --> 00:32:42,045
No, she didn't.

675
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:45,081
Oh, okay. And do you know what the family wants to do with it?

676
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,827
We haven't talked in depth about it, but I'm pretty sure they're gonna sell it.

677
00:32:48,057 --> 00:32:50,114
Well, we would really like to buy it.

678
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:52,594
- And keep it as an inn.
- Yes, a wonderful inn.

679
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,527
- Dedicated to Fran.
- Yes, but keep it the Dragonfly.

680
00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:57,341
And we promise not to burn it down.

681
00:32:57,483 --> 00:33:00,443
Oh, yes, that's right. Hey, we could put that in the agreement. Ow...

682
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:03,822
- Here, why don't you...
- Thank you.

683
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:06,955
- Anyway, what do you say?
- Well...

684
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:08,953
Excuse me, but you're blocking her view.

685
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,691
Oh, sorry Kirk, sorry. So you were saying?

686
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,999
I'll tell you what, you contact me on Monday

687
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:16,438
and we can discuss this.

688
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:19,593
As far as I'm concerned, if the check clears, it's all yours.

689
00:33:21,312 --> 00:33:23,243
- It's all ours.
- It's all ours.

690
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:36,255
We're closed. Learn to read.

691
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:40,688
You're the loser coffee guy.

692
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,387
Well, not as cool as Bono, but I'll take it.

693
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,694
- We're...
- Closed. Yeah, I heard.

694
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:49,587
- Okay, so we're still...
- I'm your father.

695
00:33:49,838 --> 00:33:53,156
- closed. What?
- I'm your...

696
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,400
- Are you sure?
- Am I... yes, I'm sure.

697
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:03,766
I didn't mean to spring this on you. I thought Luke would've told you that I...

698
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:04,810
Luke would've told me?

699
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,667
Well, yeah, he came to see me last night. He didn't tell you.

700
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:10,714
That's obvious because you're still doing the staring with the frown and...

701
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,970
you look different.

702
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:21,892
- You want some coffee?
- Sure.

703
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:32,454
Thanks.

704
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:34,676
It's old.

705
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:11,277
I gotta go.

706
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,419
- I was negotiating at a funeral.
- I saw.

707
00:35:23,685 --> 00:35:25,779
Which might've been the most inappropriate thing to happen today

708
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:29,093
until that gnat flew into Kirk's mouth and he freaked and dropped the casket.

709
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,096
It was a nice save.

710
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:31,841
I'm feeling so weird.

711
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:36,998
I'm completely sad about Fran, but the inn... it's really gonna happen.

712
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:38,145
Yeah, seems like it.

713
00:35:41,126 --> 00:35:41,754
Hey, come here.

714
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,223
That one would look great on you.

715
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:48,176
Oh, I don't know.

716
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:49,486
We should come back tomorrow and try it on.

717
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:51,473
- Maybe.
- Hey, prom's coming up, kid.

718
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:54,058
We need to get you a dress. Unless you want me to make you one.

719
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:54,969
No, that's okay.

720
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:57,679
Maybe we could hit the mall tomorrow after school.

721
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,409
I could meet you in Hartford and we could go to a fancy store

722
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:01,964
where they'll follow us around like we're thieves.

723
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:03,669
I don't wanna talk about dresses anymore.

724
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:05,430
We've only been talking about dresses for two minutes.

725
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:07,448
- Well, it feels like longer.
- Rory.

726
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:08,995
And I don't know if I even need a dress, okay,

727
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,648
'cause I don't even know if I'm going to the prom.

728
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:13,357
- I thought Jess agreed.
- Well, that was before.

729
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,934
- Before what?
- Before the party,

730
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,972
before the fight, before the thing in Kyle's bedroom.

731
00:36:17,095 --> 00:36:18,001
Okay, come with me.

732
00:36:24,673 --> 00:36:27,618
Okay, we left off with the thing in Kyle's bedroom.

733
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,762
I don't understand. One minute he's happy, then he's not.

734
00:36:29,876 --> 00:36:31,411
And he doesn't tell me anything ever.

735
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,244
I mean, you're supposed to tell your girlfriend things.

736
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,103
That's the whole point of having a girlfriend, isn't it?

737
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,196
Yes, it is. Now, Kyle's bedroom, what happened there?

738
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,623
And I'm so tired of fighting. Or not even fighting because he won't fight.

739
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:43,351
He just gets mad and disappears and then comes back

740
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,779
and I don't like how I feel and I don't like what I do.

741
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,007
Like what you do where, in Kyle's bedroom?

742
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,475
I don't wanna feel like this, I don't wanna sit around wondering

743
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,605
when we're going to talk, if he's mad, why he's mad.

744
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:54,146
I hate this. I really, really...

745
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,548
Honey, you gotta tell Mommy what happened in Kyle's bedroom!

746
00:36:56,819 --> 00:36:59,276
Jess was upset and I went to look for him and we were kissing

747
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:00,587
and then it seemed like he wanted to...

748
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,799
- Did you?
- No, I didn't.

749
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,842
And then he got all weird like he was mad at me.

750
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,980
Hey, if he was mad at you because you wouldn't have sex with him,

751
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,491
- then he's a jerk.
- I know that,

752
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:13,553
but I don't even know if that's why he's mad at me. I don't know if he's mad at me.

753
00:37:13,644 --> 00:37:15,237
I don't know anything because he won't talk.

754
00:37:15,344 --> 00:37:17,698
He just sulks then disappears, and just when you're through with him,

755
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:20,065
he shows up at hockey games with Distiller tickets.

756
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:20,890
Distiller tickets?

757
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:24,638
What Distiller tickets?

758
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,592
Oh, that's right, you don't know about that because I didn't tell you

759
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,773
because I was embarrassed because I didn't wanna be that girl

760
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,906
and you don't want me to be that girl, but after the hockey game, I was that girl.

761
00:37:33,015 --> 00:37:34,710
What girl? Help me, drag me along, honey.

762
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:36,639
The girl who lets her boyfriend treat her like dirt

763
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:38,012
and then lies to her mom about it.

764
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,240
Okay, you need a breath here.

765
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:45,661
Something's going on with him and it's been going on for awhile.

766
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:49,124
You can't make him talk, Rory. He has to want to.

767
00:37:49,272 --> 00:37:50,377
But why doesn't he want to?

768
00:37:50,653 --> 00:37:52,317
Because it's probably hard for him.

769
00:37:54,335 --> 00:37:56,348
Hey, we're not leaving. We're gonna live in this car

770
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,482
and we're gonna die in this car, so find another frickin' spot.

771
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,807
- Honey...
- I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

772
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:08,928
I'm tired of talking about it. I'm just... tired.

773
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:19,308
So...

774
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:21,355
- Nothing happened.
- Okay.

775
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,571
You hungry? I can make us some eggs.

776
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:29,537
So I hear you went to see my father last night.

777
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:33,188
Yeah, I did.

778
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:35,496
- Were you gonna tell me?
- He came by?

779
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:37,402
- He came by.
- I didn't think he'd have the guts.

780
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:41,269
- So what were you thinking?
- Jess, I don't like your father very much.

781
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:44,114
So because you don't like him, that means I can't know he's here?

782
00:38:44,227 --> 00:38:46,101
- You know he's here.
- No thanks to you.

783
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,806
Shouldn't have come from me in the first place.

784
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:50,735
So what, you don't think you owed it to me to tell me, prepare me?

785
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:53,183
No, Jess, I didn't. With everything that's going on here with you,

786
00:38:53,342 --> 00:38:55,877
I kinda hoped he'd just walk away, but...

787
00:38:56,558 --> 00:38:58,882
once again, Jimmy makes the wrong move. What a shock.

788
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,950
Who the hell are you to decide what the right move is?

789
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:03,686
I'm the one who's saving your ass constantly.

790
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:06,214
I'm the one who just wrote a check to Kyle's father

791
00:39:06,348 --> 00:39:08,447
so he wouldn't press charges against you.

792
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,676
I'm the one trying to knock some sense into that thick head of yours about the future.

793
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:16,056
- Oh, here we go.
- You don't take anything seriously.

794
00:39:16,163 --> 00:39:17,977
That's why you're doing so crappy in school.

795
00:39:18,124 --> 00:39:20,730
You're smart enough, you read more than anyone I've ever seen.

796
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:23,633
There's no reason why you should be barely graduating.

797
00:39:23,772 --> 00:39:25,159
- I'm not.
- You're not what?

798
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:27,145
- I'm not graduating.
- Yes, you are.

799
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:28,309
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

800
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:29,655
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are,

801
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,852
because we had an agreement that if you were gonna live here,

802
00:39:31,944 --> 00:39:33,936
you were gonna go to school and you were gonna graduate.

803
00:39:34,054 --> 00:39:35,646
Well, I didn't and I'm not.

804
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:39,574
What is wrong with you? What, did you do this just to spite me?

805
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,902
- Look, forget it, it's done.
- What's your life now?

806
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:43,899
Wal-Mart full time, that's your great future?

807
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:46,690
Gonna take the plunge and buy yourself a second blue vest?

808
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:49,736
Maybe, why not? What's wrong with it? I mean, it's no diner.

809
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,834
Hey, I own this business, kid! I built it, this is mine!

810
00:39:53,009 --> 00:39:55,431
I'm not at the mercy of some boss waiting and hoping

811
00:39:55,574 --> 00:39:59,224
to be chosen employee of the month for a couple extra hundred bucks and a plaque.

812
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:00,617
I'm always employee of the month.

813
00:40:00,709 --> 00:40:03,315
I'm employee of the year, of the century, of the universe.

814
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:05,600
You should be so lucky to have a job like mine.

815
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:12,338
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

816
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:15,764
You're gonna live here one more year, you're gonna quit you job,

817
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:19,660
you're gonna take twelfth grade over again, and you will graduate.

818
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:21,328
- No.
- I'm not playing with you here, Jess.

819
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,828
You quit your job, you go to school.

820
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:26,495
- I am not going back to school!
- So that's it?

821
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,719
Yeah, that's it.

822
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:30,187
Then you gotta go.

823
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:42,128
I thought I smelled coffee.

824
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:44,611
Good morning your highness. I trust you slept well.

825
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:47,899
And to what do I owe this lovely display of domesticity?

826
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,704
Well, being brilliant and all, I figured you would probably still not be

827
00:40:50,787 --> 00:40:52,573
in the mood to go to Luke's this morning,

828
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:54,544
so I thought we'd have a nice little breakfast here.

829
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:55,369
Wow, okay.

830
00:40:55,932 --> 00:40:56,823
- Hey.
- Good?

831
00:40:57,049 --> 00:40:58,691
- These are from Luke's.
- What?

832
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:01,068
You got up this morning, went to Luke's and brought this back.

833
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:02,518
I sure as hell am not gonna cook.

834
00:41:03,192 --> 00:41:03,997
They're good, thank you.

835
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,400
Put 'em on a plate just the way you like 'em.

836
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:07,170
Well, there it is.

837
00:41:08,303 --> 00:41:11,718
"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Lister announce the engagement of their daughter

838
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:15,030
Lindsay Ann to Dean Forrester, son of Randy and Barbara Forrester."

839
00:41:15,584 --> 00:41:17,120
My God, they're a good looking couple.

840
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:18,819
If their kids can sing there's no stopping 'em.

841
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:21,001
I still don't understand why they need to get married.

842
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,771
Maybe they have to get married before he grows so tall

843
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:25,267
she won't be able to talk to him anymore.

844
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,752
I really do want him to be happy.

845
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:29,034
I know. You're good in that department.

846
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:32,062
Some people get married young and everything turns out fine.

847
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:34,124
- Absolutely.
- That'd be nice.

848
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:35,738
Well, we'll keep a good thought.

849
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:38,923
Hey, here's a picture of Kirk pinned by the casket.

850
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:40,258
Oh, yeah, that's a good one.

851
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:43,392
Man, it's bad enough this had to happen, but his pants splitting on top of it?

852
00:41:43,515 --> 00:41:46,280
Yeah. I hope he never takes too close a look at his life.

853
00:41:46,392 --> 00:41:48,226
Amen. So this goes on the fridge, right?

854
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:50,032
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Good.

855
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,167
- Can I sit?
- Sure, sit.

856
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:25,585
I thought you took an earlier bus.

857
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:28,400
My first class got canceled today.

858
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:33,006
So what's been going on?

859
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,921
- Nothing much. Fran died.
- I heard.

860
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,273
- I went to her funeral yesterday.
- Luke went, too.

861
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:40,597
- I saw him there.
- Yeah?

862
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:41,524
He was in the back.

863
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:50,822
I can't go to the prom.

864
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:53,936
I couldn't get tickets.

865
00:42:58,006 --> 00:42:58,570
Sorry.

866
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:06,081
- This is my stop.
- Okay.

867
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:08,805
So, you'll call me?

868
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:10,981
Yeah, I'll call you.

869
00:43:11,305 --> 00:44:11,907
