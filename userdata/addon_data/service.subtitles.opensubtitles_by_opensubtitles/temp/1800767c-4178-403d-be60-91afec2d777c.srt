1
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,914
I've always loved trains.

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:16,017
In fact, if my career

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,454
in theoretical physics hadn't
worked out, my backup plan

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,890
was to become a
professional ticket taker.

5
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:23,258
Or hobo.

6
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:33,602
And when I figured out
that trains allowed me

7
00:00:33,604 --> 00:00:35,604
to prove Newton's first law...

8
00:00:35,606 --> 00:00:38,070
An object in motion stays in motion

9
00:00:38,073 --> 00:00:40,441
with the same speed and
in the same direction

10
00:00:40,444 --> 00:00:43,297
unless acted upon by
an unbalanced force...

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,381
I felt like Neil Armstrong on the moon,

12
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:48,416
alone and happy.

13
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:50,024
Shelly, dinner's ready!

14
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:55,332
I don't care how dimwitted you are.

15
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:58,360
Scientific principles
have to make you smile.

16
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:01,157
Of course, nobody I knew in East Texas

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,133
in 1989 cared about Newtonian physics.

18
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:07,057
The only Newtons they cared about

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,593
were Wayne and Fig.

20
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:10,405
Sheldon, if you don't get in here,

21
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:12,841
- I'm gonna lick your toothbrush!
- Coming!

22
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:14,342
That's my sister.

23
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,523
And she's done it before.

24
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:21,520
The hell were you doing

25
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:22,802
- out there?
- George,

26
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:23,756
language.

27
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:25,194
What language? So?

28
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:27,663
I was exploring dimensional kinematics.

29
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,128
Admit it... He's adopted.

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,552
How can I be adopted

31
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:31,955
when I have a twin sister?

32
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,799
Think, monkey, think.

33
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:34,802
That's enough.

34
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:35,804
No one's adopted.

35
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:36,706
I wish I was.

36
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:38,203
That can still be arranged.

37
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:39,591
Now, let's pray.

38
00:01:39,594 --> 00:01:41,177
A moment, please.

39
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:45,567
- Leave him be.
- He can hold hands

40
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,136
with his family. It won't kill him.

41
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:48,639
We don't know that.

42
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,783
Georgie, did you wash
your hands before dinner?

43
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:52,254
Or even this week?

44
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:53,483
None of your business.

45
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:54,944
Hence the mittens.

46
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:58,444
Thank you, God, for this food

47
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:00,944
we're about to receive and for
the nourishment of our bodies,

48
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:02,671
and bless the hands that prepared it.

49
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:03,929
Amen.

50
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,812
How come we ain't got no tater tots?

51
00:02:07,815 --> 00:02:09,371
I made tater tots last night.

52
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:10,707
I'd take tater tots

53
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,327
over mashed potaters any day.

54
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,238
- Just eat what I made you.
- Can we at least

55
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,541
have tater tots tomorrow?

56
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:17,465
It was family dinners like this

57
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:20,531
that led me to adopt
a midAtlantic accent.

58
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:22,256
Nobel Prize winners...

59
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,359
ought not be orderin' tater tots.

60
00:02:24,362 --> 00:02:26,328
Everybody excited to
start school Monday?

61
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:27,186
I am.

62
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,854
I guess so.

63
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,189
Georgie?

64
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,919
Freshman year, that's a big deal.

65
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:33,559
How can I be excited when he's gonna be

66
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:34,856
in the same grade as me?

67
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:36,510
Don't worry, Georgie, I'm not planning

68
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:38,892
on being in the ninth
grade for very long.

69
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:41,395
All I know is he's not in
the same grade as me anymore,

70
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:42,663
and I'm thrilled.

71
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:44,622
Good luck with your finger painting.

72
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,572
You're gonna get your
ass kicked in high school.

73
00:02:46,575 --> 00:02:48,099
Hey, language.

74
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,536
I'm not going to be assaulted.

75
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,602
High school is a haven
for higher learning.

76
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:52,938
Dear God.

77
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:54,941
Speaking of God, who's going to church

78
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:56,639
- with me tomorrow?
- I can't.

79
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,259
I'm meeting with the other coaches.

80
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,528
You can't meet after church?

81
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,416
No, Mary, I can't meet after church.

82
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:04,150
Georgie?

83
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:06,953
I got to study my playbook.

84
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:11,058
I'll go with you, Mom.

85
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,426
Why are you going?

86
00:03:12,428 --> 00:03:14,177
- You don't believe in God.
- No,

87
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,692
but I believe in Mom.

88
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,297
I'll take it. Missy?

89
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:18,699
Can't, Heather asked me to...

90
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:21,335
- You're goin'.
- Son of a bitch.

91
00:03:21,337 --> 00:03:22,536
Hey.

92
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,104
Missy... Don't you

93
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:28,842
throw something at the
dinner table. George Jr.

94
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:32,072
Jane Goodall had to go
to Africa to study apes.

95
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:33,207
Hey!

96
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,182
I just had to go to dinner.

97
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:37,468
Never at the dinner table!

98
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:39,070
You knock that off, George!

99
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:41,187
DDo not retaliate!

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,074

101
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:04,144
In Matthew nine, verse four, Jesus said,

102
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:08,415
"Why would you entertain
evil thoughts in your hearts?"

103
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:10,684
- Do you have evil thoughts?
- Shh.

104
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,799
I just don't think
this part applies to me.

105
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:15,287
That's fine. Be quiet and listen.

106
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,221
I'm only nine years old.

107
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,257
Most evil doesn't start till puberty.

108
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:21,705
Hello.

109
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,872
Philippians 4:8,

110
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,032
"Finally, brothers, whatever is..."

111
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,734
Do you have evil thoughts?

112
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,169
I'm having one right now.

113
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,382
Really? What is it?

114
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,106
When we get home, I'm gonna
kick your little balls.

115
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:36,610
You can't. They haven't descended yet.

116
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:38,945
- Mom?
- What?

117
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,348
When should I be expecting my testicles?

118
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,582
"Whatever is admirable..."

119
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:44,722
What is wrong with him?

120
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:46,440
Nothin' is wrong with him.

121
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:48,867
Now, turn around before
I knock your lights out.

122
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,820
Think continually on these things.

123
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:53,231
A good thought leads

124
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:54,727
to a good thing.

125
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,825
You feel it in your body.
You feel it in your...

126
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:59,141
My mom was my Christian soldier.

127
00:04:59,144 --> 00:05:01,501
Leads to evil things
and sits there and...

128
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:04,588
And for the record, they
descended when I was 15.

129
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:20,930
Shelly, it's your last day of
summer. Go out and enjoy it.

130
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:23,098
But I have to learn
the student handbook.

131
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,367
Ooh, did you know extreme hairstyles,

132
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:27,711
goatees and mustaches are not allowed?

133
00:05:27,714 --> 00:05:30,586
I didn't. I personally
find that very reassuring.

134
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:32,805
Look what a beautiful day it is.

135
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:47,310
Go play.

136
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,893
"Go play"... if only
life were that simple.

137
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,596
There, I played.

138
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:00,035
Hey, Sheldon!

139
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:01,760
Hello, Billy Sparks.

140
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:04,306
- Hello, Matilda Sparks.
- I heard

141
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:06,609
- you're going to high school tomorrow.
- I am.

142
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:08,510
You're going to have
to find someone else

143
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:10,179
to torment on the playground.

144
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:12,281
"Torment"?

145
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:14,383
It means to maliciously harass.

146
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:16,085
"Her ass"?

147
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:17,553
That's funny.

148
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:19,060
Well, this was nice.

149
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:20,623
Hey, doofus!

150
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,659
Mom!

151
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:27,129
- Good girl.
- Mom!

152
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:29,711
What am I supposed to
do? His feet are growing.

153
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:31,567
Why can't he wear Georgie's old shoes?

154
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:32,768
He won't hold your hand.

155
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,129
You think he's gonna put his feet

156
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,365
in his brother's smelly shoes?

157
00:06:35,368 --> 00:06:37,142
Well, we damn well
better cut back somewhere.

158
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:39,001
Will you please keep your voice down?

159
00:06:40,044 --> 00:06:42,057
They're fighting about you again.

160
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,175
They're fighting about money.

161
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:46,949
It's a common argument in marriages.

162
00:06:48,586 --> 00:06:50,252
Lights out.

163
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:51,798
Big day tomorrow.

164
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:54,156
Mom?

165
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,726
Do we have financial problems?

166
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:00,396
Don't you worry about that.

167
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:01,897
We are fine.

168
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,366
Now, go to sleep.

169
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:08,637
She's lying. She just said
that to make you feel better.

170
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,006
Mom doesn't lie.

171
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:12,608
Sure, she thinks

172
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,343
the Earth was made in six days,

173
00:07:14,345 --> 00:07:16,855
but that's 'cause she's
gullible, not a liar.

174
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:22,351
Mom,

175
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:24,553
Sheldon can't find his bowtie.

176
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:27,066
Really? I laid it out for him.

177
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,321
Leave it alone, Mary.
He doesn't need a bowtie.

178
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,924
It's his first day of school.
Let him wear what he wants.

179
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:34,584
Mom, I can't find my bowtie!

180
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,999
Dear Lord, why's he
got to wear a bowtie?

181
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,468
Can I drive in with you?

182
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,856
Sure.

183
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,037
Everybody's gonna
know he's your brother.

184
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,540
It's gonna be awful for you.

185
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:45,841
Tell her to shut up.

186
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:47,543
She's not wrong.

187
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:51,113
- It's got to be here.
- It's not.

188
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:53,982
It's not! Shelly,
stay calm. We'll find it.

189
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:56,284
- My tie is gone! My tie is gone!
- Shelly,

190
00:07:56,287 --> 00:07:57,620
you don't really need a tie.

191
00:07:57,623 --> 00:08:00,828
I have to find my tie.
I have to find my tie.

192
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,303
Be right back.

193
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:05,526
Professor Proton wears a bowtie!

194
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,514
George Junior,

195
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:10,393
- give me back that bowtie right now!
- I didn't take it!

196
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:13,271
- Don't you lie to me!
- I'm not lying!

197
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:16,672
- We'll see about that.
- Stay out of my room!

198
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:18,440
She's gonna find your dirty magazines.

199
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:19,808
Shut up!

200
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,814
You are not having a good day.

201
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:35,824
Hey. Hey, he didn't take it.

202
00:08:35,826 --> 00:08:38,193
- Then what happened to it?!
- Help me find my bowtie!

203
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:40,229
I'll check in the bathroom!

204
00:08:40,231 --> 00:08:41,663
I took it.

205
00:08:41,665 --> 00:08:43,966
- Why would you do that?
- Mary,

206
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,410
the boy is nine years old
and going into high school.

207
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:47,813
Isn't that weird enough?

208
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,570
Give it to me. Come on.

209
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:51,039
It's not just Sheldon.

210
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:52,908
Georgie's gonna be in class with him.

211
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,710
Not in the bathroom!

212
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:56,071
Give it.

213
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:10,559
Would you like to play a driving game?

214
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:12,492
Not really. I always lose.

215
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:14,125
I know. That's why it's fun.

216
00:09:14,128 --> 00:09:17,231
How about license
plates with prime numbers

217
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,535
- followed by a cons...?
- Why don't we just talk?

218
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:20,602
Very well.

219
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:23,283
You understand

220
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,486
that some people are
gonna be intimidated by you

221
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:27,222
'cause of how smart you are?

222
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:29,303
Or maybe they'll recognize my intellect

223
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:31,280
and make me their leader.

224
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:33,682
Lord, look after my son.

225
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:36,718
Don't let him get stuffed in a gym bag.

226
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:50,799
Dear.

227
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:52,267
Yeah.

228
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,912
That boy has an exposed tattoo.

229
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:55,971
He does.

230
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:56,908
I wonder if he knows

231
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:59,074
that's in violation of the dress code.

232
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:03,779
Speaking of which, how
about we lose the bowtie?

233
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,547
Why?

234
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:08,116
Look around, honey. None of
the other kids are wearing one.

235
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:09,827
Well, perhaps I'll start a fad.

236
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:12,354
No, you won't. Please trust Mommy.

237
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,756
All right, tell you what.

238
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:17,459
You take it off, and this weekend,

239
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:19,728
I'll take you to RadioShack.

240
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:30,839
You doing okay?

241
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,455
I guess.

242
00:10:34,011 --> 00:10:35,644
I smell ammonia.

243
00:10:35,646 --> 00:10:38,046
They must've done a
thorough cleaning recently.

244
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,815
I like that.

245
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:43,485
And remember, if anybody
bothers you, what do you say?

246
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:45,454
My dad's a football coach.

247
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:47,692
And? My brother's a football player.

248
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:48,757
Good.

249
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,364
Hey, Mom, look.

250
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,634
That girl's pregnant.

251
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:54,237
Congratulations.

252
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:05,299
Well, that was revolting.

253
00:11:05,302 --> 00:11:08,062
All right. This is your homeroom.

254
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:09,764
Do you want me to go in with you?

255
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:12,418
No. Although I could've
used you in the restroom.

256
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,802
Okay, well...

257
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:16,137
You have a good day.

258
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,606
And I'll pick you up after school,

259
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:19,274
same door we came in.

260
00:11:19,276 --> 00:11:21,910
Are you crying or
having an allergy attack?

261
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:24,246
Allergies.

262
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,814
It's probably the ammonia.

263
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:27,716
Probably.

264
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:30,714
Okay. Let the learning begin.

265
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:44,266
All right, everybody,
my name is Ms. MacElroy.

266
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,786
In addition to being
your homeroom teacher,

267
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,237
I'll be seeing some of
you in my English class,

268
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:51,239
and some of you on the volleyball court.

269
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:53,074
Just to give you a little history,

270
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:55,977
I've been here at
Medford for 29 years...

271
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,156
I taught some of your
older brothers and sisters,

272
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,782
and sadly, some of your parents.

273
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,718
Not much I haven't seen.

274
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,630
Until today.

275
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:08,734
I'm sure you're well aware
we have a student with us,

276
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:11,026
who, despite his young age,

277
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:13,138
is remarkably gifted.

278
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:16,565
And I expect y'all to
make him feel welcome.

279
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:18,937
Yes, Sheldon?

280
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,369
Per the student dress and grooming code,

281
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,305
this boy's hair is too long,

282
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:25,097
this boy is wearing sports attire

283
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,147
outside of a designated area

284
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,514
and this girl's blouse is diaphanous,

285
00:12:29,517 --> 00:12:31,775
which means I can see her brassiere.

286
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:34,182
Thank you.

287
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:36,084
I will take that into account.

288
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:37,419
All right.

289
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,688
We have a few minutes
before first period.

290
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,829
I need y'all to fill out these forms.

291
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:42,891
What?

292
00:12:42,893 --> 00:12:44,181
Also in violation

293
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:46,061
of the grooming code on page 48,

294
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:48,129
article five, subsection B,

295
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:50,231
you have a bit of a mustache.

296
00:12:52,611 --> 00:12:54,803
This is a stupid idea. This boy does not

297
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:56,204
belong in our school.

298
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:58,073
Come on Vicky, it's just the first day.

299
00:12:58,075 --> 00:12:59,908
Why don't we all just
take a deep breath here?

300
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:02,802
The hell with that. Five
minutes into my math class,

301
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:04,016
he questioned my credentials.

302
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,981
How am I supposed to control a
classroom when a kid accuses me

303
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,849
of being in breach of the hygiene code?

304
00:13:07,851 --> 00:13:09,651
Well, Hubert, it wouldn't
kill you to shower

305
00:13:09,653 --> 00:13:12,008
a little more often. George,
you want to weigh in here?

306
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,208
- Well...
- Oral Roberts University

307
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,323
is a wonderful school.

308
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,092
He said I was intimidated
by his intelligence,

309
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:18,268
and then,

310
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:20,929
he offered to be my "leader."

311
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:07,776
Do you know this sonata?

312
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,110
No.

313
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:11,212
How long have you played the piano?

314
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:13,882
I don't play piano.

315
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:16,251
George,

316
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:17,719
you got any thoughts here?

317
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,120
I certainly do.

318
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,290
Mary, tell him.

319
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:25,160
It's simple. We don't have a choice.

320
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:26,728
Well, you gave it a shot.

321
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,630
We wish you luck with
Sheldon elsewhere...

322
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:30,477
No, no, no.

323
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,766
We don't have a choice.

324
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:33,001
He's got to stay here.

325
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,290
We can't afford

326
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:35,179
private school.

327
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:36,525
I sure can't homeschool him.

328
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,880
He's doing calculus and
Euclidean something or other.

329
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,183
Euclidean geometry.

330
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,910
Guess where I learned that.

331
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:43,645
Yeah, yeah, we know.

332
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:46,081
All I care about is that

333
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,750
my son gets the education
he deserves, so you all

334
00:14:48,753 --> 00:14:50,318
are gonna have to figure this out.

335
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,953
Coach, can you help me out here, please?

336
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:53,488
'Cause I'm dyin'.

337
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:58,481
I'd rather not.

338
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,497
G minor.

339
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,622
F.

340
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,472
E flat.

341
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:12,769
C minor.

342
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:17,312
You have perfect pitch.

343
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,813
Okay.

344
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:22,450
Sweetheart, you should
really pursue music.

345
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:25,353
No, thank you. Musicians take drugs.

346
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:28,664
Is there a faculty restroom I could use?

347
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:44,806
Cooper, Stinson, you're up.

348
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:48,276
Hey, look, it's the dumb brother.

349
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,747
Okay.

350
00:15:58,262 --> 00:15:59,951
That's enough. Hey.

351
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,160
Hey, that's enough!

352
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,531
- Hey, hey!
- That's enough!

353
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,832
Georgie.

354
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,550
Georgie! Georgie!

355
00:16:07,553 --> 00:16:09,185
Stop! Stop!

356
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:15,136
What the hell is wrong with you?

357
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:18,907
You okay?

358
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:20,958
No, I'm not okay.

359
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,386
Where you think you're going?

360
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:33,354
I quit. I don't want to play anymore!

361
00:16:33,356 --> 00:16:36,580
- Since when?
- Since right now!

362
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,096
All right, what is going on?

363
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:40,195
What do you think's going on?!

364
00:16:40,197 --> 00:16:42,351
You mean Sheldon?

365
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:46,835
You can't let that bother you.

366
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,132
It doesn't bother you?

367
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:50,249
You got called to the
principal's office.

368
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,440
Yeah, that wasn't so great.

369
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:54,153
I can't be in the same school as him!

370
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:55,794
Well, I don't see what choice you have.

371
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:59,004
Right. Ever since he could
talk, I quit having any choices.

372
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:08,289
I know it's hard.

373
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:12,227
I'm telling you, as your
coach, quit your whining,

374
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:14,596
get your uniform on and you
get your ass back out there.

375
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:17,599
But what about as my dad?

376
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,168
Your dad is having a bad day.

377
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,719
Listen to your coach.

378
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:32,112
Can a clock be powered
by an ordinary potato?

379
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:34,148
I hope so, boys and girls,

380
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,516
or this is going to be
a really boring episode.

381
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,386
The supplies you'll need...

382
00:17:39,389 --> 00:17:41,322
Why can't we watch DuckTales?

383
00:17:41,324 --> 00:17:44,492
'Cause we don't learn
anything watching DuckTales.

384
00:17:44,494 --> 00:17:47,918
It's TV, we aren't supposed to learn.

385
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:50,831
Two alligator grips and, let's see...

386
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,097
Of course, a clock.

387
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,469
Missy, go somewhere else. I
need to talk to your brother.

388
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:58,039
Why don't you go somewhere
else and I can watch Duck...

389
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,307
Go!

390
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,697
I hate everybody.

391
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,568
It's time for science.

392
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:10,207
Hey, he was about to power
a clock with a potato.

393
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,418
Not possible.

394
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:13,354
- Now, listen...
- Am I in trouble?

395
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:15,234
No.

396
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:17,234
Maybe. Just listen.

397
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:21,329
You're not gonna make it in this school

398
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,012
if you keep ratting people out.

399
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:24,745
But they were breaking
the grooming codes

400
00:18:24,748 --> 00:18:26,153
and the dress codes.

401
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:29,591
I saw one boy with
a Tshirt that said...

402
00:18:29,594 --> 00:18:30,989
"Bite me."

403
00:18:30,992 --> 00:18:33,341
Yeah. Thatthat's terrible.

404
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,783
Sheldon, let me tell you a little story.

405
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:38,179
Did you ever wonder why we
moved from Galveston to Medford?

406
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:41,783
No. I tend to wonder
about the bigger questions.

407
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:44,118
Okay, well, here's why.

408
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,921
Your dad had a real good coaching job

409
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:49,457
and I saw some
grownups breaking rules.

410
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,468
What'd they do?

411
00:18:50,471 --> 00:18:52,705
Ilt's kind of complicated, but...

412
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,859
football coaches aren't
allowed to recruit kids

413
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,304
from other high schools
to play on their teams.

414
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:58,567
And you told on them?

415
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,551
Yeah. You know what happened?

416
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:03,571
Justice descended
upon the rule breakers?

417
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:07,141
I got fired, Sheldon.

418
00:19:07,143 --> 00:19:09,177
And I got a bad reputation.

419
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,080
That's why you drink so much beer.

420
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,482
Just do yourself a favor.

421
00:19:17,485 --> 00:19:19,477
Okay? Go to school tomorrow,

422
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,223
and mind your own business.

423
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:23,329
All right?

424
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,470
Dad.

425
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:30,064
Are you sad that you got fired?

426
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:35,903
Mostly angry.

427
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:38,627
But yeah.

428
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,797
Maybe a little sad.

429
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:50,687
All right, let's say grace.

430
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:56,750
Thank you, God,

431
00:19:56,753 --> 00:19:59,761
for this food we are about to receive.

432
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,267
That was the first time

433
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,272
I held my father's hand.

434
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:14,442
Our bodies and bless the
hands that prepared it.

435
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:15,682
Amen.

436
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:17,218
- Amen.
- Amen.

437
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:23,418
Hey, George Jr., wait your turn.

438
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,421
I wouldn't touch my brother's hand

439
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,155
until 17 years later,

440
00:20:27,157 --> 00:20:29,711
thanks to the invention of Purell.

441
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:48,937
You know what I find comforting?

442
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,206
What's that, baby?

443
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,408
In a world filled with uncertainty,

444
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:54,244
this place will be here forever.

445
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:58,415
Hey, Sheldon, how you doing?
