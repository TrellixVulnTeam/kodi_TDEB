1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,923
"Where's the ladies room?"

2
00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:02,175
"More coffee, please. "

3
00:00:02,276 --> 00:00:04,109
"Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"

4
00:00:04,185 --> 00:00:06,929
We do not need to know how to say
"Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"

5
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:08,416
- Oh, yes, we do.
- Mom.

6
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,417
When we're in Spain, we
need to know how to say,

7
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:11,973
"Does Antonio Banderas live near here?"

8
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:14,103
When in France, "Does
Johnny Depp live near here?"

9
00:00:14,186 --> 00:00:15,993
When in Rome, "Does Gore
Vidal live near here?"

10
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:19,383
You know, you look like me, yet
my ways are completely lost on you.

11
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:22,121
Come on, honey, put that down.
You've been studying all day.

12
00:00:22,228 --> 00:00:23,801
I can't put it down,
I've got finals coming up.

13
00:00:23,892 --> 00:00:26,536
I know you have finals coming up,
but you also have a piece of pie

14
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:28,419
sitting there that you've
been completely ignoring.

15
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:29,762
Just let me get to the
end of this chapter.

16
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:30,600
Oh, fine.

17
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:34,093
How important do you think
it is to be able to say,

18
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,304
- "Help, I'm bleeding from the head"?
- Just bring the phrase books.

19
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,275
No. If we learn all the phrases we need,

20
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:40,749
then the phrase books are one
less thing we have to lug around.

21
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:43,411
We will never be able to learn
all the phrases in every language

22
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:44,610
that we're going to
need. Bring the books.

23
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:47,398
We can learn enough. Plus, doesn't
everybody speak English over there anyway?

24
00:00:47,543 --> 00:00:50,128
- Ugly American, party of one.
- Fine, we'll bring the books.

25
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:51,782
Okay, five minutes for pie.

26
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:53,128
Finally.

27
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:54,782
They're here, I've got them.

28
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:55,962
You've got what?

29
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,495
- The brochures for my college.
- You seem chipper.

30
00:00:58,664 --> 00:01:01,080
I am. I have decided to make this whole

31
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:03,932
Seventh Day Adventist
College experience a good one.

32
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:07,133
I'm gonna look on the bright side, find the
silver lining, and make myself some lemonade.

33
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:09,149
- Good for you.
- The campus looks pretty.

34
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:09,872
Very pretty.

35
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:12,913
It's got two huge parks
with gardens and lakes.

36
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,508
- Two parks.
- One for boys and one for girls.

37
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:19,569
And you know, I had originally thought
that this was gonna be a suffocating place

38
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:21,657
with out of date rules
and insane restrictions,

39
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,845
but boy was I wrong.

40
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:25,318
For example, curfew is up to 9:30.

41
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:27,478
9:45 if you're going for your Masters.

42
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,750
Makeup will be permitted, as long as
it identically matches your skin tone.

43
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:35,088
And owning a Rolling Stones CD is
no longer grounds for expulsion.

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,838
You can work the demerits off
in the campus clean-up crew.

45
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,936
There's a separate park for boys?

46
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:41,477
My life is over.

47
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,474
- Oh, no, I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

48
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:47,114
- Well, it is over.
- It's not over.

49
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,684
Every kid in that brochure
was awkward and panicked.

50
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:52,490
It looked like the Academy Award
audience during Michael Moore's speech.

51
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:54,881
Hey, why don't you add the phrase
"Just sit there and look pretty"

52
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,992
to that list of yours there, okay?
I've gotta go back to studying.

53
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,082
"Does that sexy guy in the Peugeot ad

54
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:02,920
who had a bit part in
Armageddon live near here?"

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,074

56
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:43,548
- Oh, God, Rory, you scared me.
- Sorry.

57
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,648
I've been sneaking around here like
an idiot trying not to wake you up.

58
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,707
I've been up for hours.

59
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,691
Why? Did you have a bad dream?

60
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:53,665
The one where you finally meet Christiane
Amanpour and she's really stupid?

61
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:55,973
No, I realized last
night that at this rate,

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,582
I will never finish all
the work I have to do.

63
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,854
- What work?
- What work? What work, she asks.

64
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,346
Well, you know me and that dippy
Christiane, takes a little while to catch up.

65
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:04,007
Here.

66
00:04:04,422 --> 00:04:07,182
Things to do before
graduation. A list, of course.

67
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:10,017
Study for finals, senior
breakfast, senior awards,

68
00:04:10,156 --> 00:04:11,769
finish final edition of the Franklin,

69
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,878
organize a new student government,

70
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,443
convince Paris to give up student gavel.

71
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:19,961
Oh, and I forgot
- man the yearbook distribution table this afternoon

72
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:22,104
at the stupid Senior
Palooza. Unbelievable.

73
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:25,430
I'll be manning the Booster Club
Grad Night table at the same time,

74
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,488
so we can feel stupid
and abused together.

75
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,669
I can't finish all this
and sleep at the same time.

76
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:31,876
You have to sleep, it's
what keeps you pretty.

77
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:33,821
Who cares if I'm pretty
if I fail my finals?

78
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:36,336
Okay, you've got this
so completely backwards.

79
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:38,086
What is all this?

80
00:04:38,932 --> 00:04:41,426
I found that if I focus
too much on one subject,

81
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:42,663
I start to get a little punchy.

82
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:45,608
This way, when I hit
Bolshevik Revolution overload,

83
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:48,859
I just shift over here and, oh,
hello, Anne Boleyn is going down,

84
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,422
and then when that gets too
depressing, it's right over to calculus.

85
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:53,812
Saving the party subject for last?

86
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:56,375
This shifting back and forth
seems to produce better results.

87
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,101
I think you're pushing
yourself too hard.

88
00:04:58,296 --> 00:04:59,233
I made out a schedule.

89
00:04:59,393 --> 00:05:01,225
Every single moment of every single day

90
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,904
from now until graduation
is accounted for.

91
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:04,999
You left off the Kiwanis Luncheon.

92
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:06,820
- I did? Are you sure?
- It's on Monday.

93
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:10,047
How could I forget the Kiwanis
Luncheon? They gave me their scholarship.

94
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:12,382
Oh, yes, a two hundred and
fifty dollar scholarship.

95
00:05:12,474 --> 00:05:14,112
That'll keep you in
microwave popcorn for a week.

96
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,582
I'll just have to move something around.

97
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:16,980
And I'll have to work Grandma in.

98
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:18,148
Excuse me?

99
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,893
Grandma called and asked
if I could come over

100
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,537
and help her pick out a dress
to wear to my graduation.

101
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:22,893
- No.
- I have to.

102
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:24,552
Rory, my mother's been
dressing herself for years

103
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:27,571
and she has yet to show up at a function
with her bra on the outside of her clothing.

104
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,935
She asked, I can't say no.

105
00:05:29,064 --> 00:05:31,151
Tell her about the koala
bears. She'll understand.

106
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:34,546
Please stop making fun of them. We need
every cent we can get. Yale is expensive.

107
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,676
I know Yale is expensive.

108
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,447
We haven't heard from
Yale financial aid yet.

109
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,477
We will, relax.

110
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:41,136
We had better hear from them soon

111
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,910
because I have a deposit
to send in for my room

112
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:45,718
and I have a bunch of supplies to buy

113
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:47,816
and I wanna get all of that out
of the way before we go to Europe,

114
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,032
otherwise I'll be obsessing
about it the entire time.

115
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,947
Okay, listen, I'm gonna
go out and get the paper.

116
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:57,330
Okay, don't show it to me because I have
no time for recreational reading until June.

117
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:01,073
Could we move your, uh, chill session
from four o'clock tomorrow afternoon

118
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:02,886
to... right now?
That'd be great, thanks.

119
00:06:05,026 --> 00:06:06,480
Okay, little tip -

120
00:06:06,772 --> 00:06:08,563
the whole stalking thing
works infinitely better

121
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:10,704
when you don't actually
smash your face in the window.

122
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,455
- I need to talk to you.
- Come inside.

123
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:13,760
No, Rory's in there.

124
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:17,616
Since when are you scared of Rory? 'Cause
seriously, Luke, I think you can take her.

125
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,926
I just need to tell you something.

126
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,554
- Can she hear us?
- Through the walls?

127
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:23,791
No, I put some kryptonite
in her waffles. We're good.

128
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:24,592
Come over here.

129
00:06:24,957 --> 00:06:27,046
You're freaking out
the freaks this morning.

130
00:06:28,537 --> 00:06:29,792
Jess is gone.

131
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,355
- What?
- And I don't think he's coming back.

132
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:34,415
What do you mean gone? Like gone gone?

133
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,637
- Exactly like gone gone.
- But when?

134
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,389
Last night, this morning, I don't know.

135
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,847
I went up there to get
some money out of the safe

136
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,731
and I noticed that all
of his stuff was gone.

137
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:43,728
Oh, Luke, I'm so sorry.

138
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:46,452
Yeah, well, forget it.
I'm through with him.

139
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,244
He's eighteen, he can do
whatever the hell he wants.

140
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:50,241
He's on his own, I'm through.

141
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:51,951
- Luke.
- No, it's a relief.

142
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:54,742
That kid was driving me crazy. Let
him make his own way from now on.

143
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:57,916
Let him see how far that smart mouth of his
gets him without someone watching his back.

144
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:00,856
I couldn't be more relieved.
I'm just worried about Rory.

145
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,492
- I assume she doesn't know.
- She hasn't said anything.

146
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:06,824
- I can tell her if you want me to.
- No, it's okay. I can do it.

147
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:10,355
I just have to figure out when. She's
got a lot of things on her mind right now.

148
00:07:10,506 --> 00:07:12,756
Don't wait too long.
She'll notice eventually.

149
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:14,472
Yes, okay.

150
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,851
- Thanks for coming over.
- No problem.

151
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:25,464
Luke?

152
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,338
- I failed him.
- You did not fail him.

153
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:36,253
You supported him, you defended
him, you gave him a chance,

154
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,827
and if he chose not to take it,
there's nothing more you could do.

155
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:41,573
Yeah.

156
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,322
Well, I should go.

157
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:50,261
Do you have any idea where he went?

158
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,672
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

159
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,278
Hey, there is no chill time
scheduled for four o'clock tomorrow,

160
00:08:09,395 --> 00:08:12,215
and the one thing I really don't
have time for are your jokes, missy.

161
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:17,629
Later's good.

162
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,677
- Do you need some help, friend?
- Nope.

163
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:04,662
Lived here 25 years. I can certainly point
you in a direction, make your journey easier.

164
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:07,676
Enjoy this beautiful day.

165
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:12,228
I'll have the alfalfa sprouts
and a plate of mashed yeast.

166
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:28,663
Yes, I've been holding for Mr.
Hennings. I'm Lorelai Gilmore...

167
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,150
Oh, great, hi. Listen...

168
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,583
I just received this letter saying that my
daughter did not qualify for financial aid.

169
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:38,391
Rory Gilmore...

170
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:46,225
Okay, yes, we did recently receive
seventy-five thousand dollars,

171
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:49,056
but, here's the thing
- that money is gone.

172
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,072
I gave it to my parents, so I
don't have it anymore, I swear.

173
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:53,716
You could come over here and search me.

174
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:56,052
We could open a bottle of wine
and put on some Motown and...

175
00:10:58,138 --> 00:10:59,983
Yes, that was very inappropriate.

176
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:04,108
Look, I owed my parents that money

177
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,444
because they helped me
put Rory through Chilton,

178
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:09,050
and I wanted her to go to Chilton
so that she could get into...

179
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:12,374
Harvard, but then Harvard became Yale

180
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:15,726
- long story
- and now that she's gotten into Yale, I paid them back for Chilton.

181
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:19,269
Just kind of a funny, wacky circle
we could all laugh about someday...

182
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:25,102
Yes, but, since I don't
have the money anymore,

183
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,632
it just seems like it shouldn't count.

184
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:27,876
There must be something we can do.

185
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:31,149
I mean, Rory is the most deserving
kid there is, just seriously.

186
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:32,762
You know, I don't know
if you know the Kiwanis,

187
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:34,246
but they gave her
their scholarship and...

188
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,920
I understand...

189
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:46,774
We'll just have to
figure something out...

190
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,888
Thank you. Goodbye.

191
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:19,001
Hey! Hello, is anybody home? Hey!

192
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:20,220
Pipe down!

193
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:21,780
You selling something?

194
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,746
No. Does Jimmy Mariano live here?

195
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:24,879
Does he owe you money?

196
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:25,959
No, I'm his...

197
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:28,134
Jess. I'm Jess.

198
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:29,117
Jess?

199
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,470
- Jess Marian...
- Frodo, back off now!

200
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:35,456
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

201
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,299
I just wanna see Jimmy, okay?

202
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:40,152
Hey, did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?

203
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,917
Remember when they
go to the Emerald City

204
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:45,201
and they ring the bell and the guy
with the beard stuck his head out

205
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:47,811
and they said that they wanted
to see the wizard, and he said no,

206
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,695
and they said, 'She's
got the ruby slippers',

207
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:52,230
and he said 'Well, that's a horse
of a different color. Come on in. '

208
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,518
Well, I'm the guy with the
beard and I'm saying the no

209
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,350
unless you can come up
with the ruby slippers.

210
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,104
- I'm his son.
- His son?

211
00:13:00,391 --> 00:13:02,531
Yes, his son.

212
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,524
Well, that's a horse of a
different color. Come on in.

213
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:08,936
- Do they bite?
- Just those two.

214
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,518
Which two? Hey, which two?

215
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:14,687
Great.

216
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,480
I swear I will bite you back.

217
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,879
- I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming.
- Neither did I.

218
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:26,820
I'm Sasha.

219
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,724
This is Angus, Chowder, Rufus, Legolas,

220
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:32,012
Caligula, Mudball,
General Lee, Jimmy Jam,

221
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:34,648
Terry Lewis and Spot.
Jimmy's not here right now.

222
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:37,573
Okay, I can just hang out,
walk around for awhile.

223
00:13:37,701 --> 00:13:38,827
Just tell me what time he gets home.

224
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:40,199
Why don't you come
in? I'll call his work.

225
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:41,454
Oh, well...

226
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,436
- You have a lot of pets.
- Ah, they're not all mine.

227
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:50,274
No?

228
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,232
No, some of 'em followed me
home, some of 'em hang out,

229
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,616
some of 'em just
needed a place to crash.

230
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:57,331
They drive Jimmy crazy,
actually, but what can you do?

231
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:58,764
Someone's gotta take care of 'em, right?

232
00:13:59,098 --> 00:14:02,424
I'm just gonna try and track
him down, so just wander.

233
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,300
Lee, hi, I'm looking for Jimmy...

234
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:22,079
Okay, I'll hold...

235
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:38,126
Clowns, cats, dogs. I wonder
where his tap shoes are.

236
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,802
He wasn't at work, but his guy
said he'll be back any second.

237
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:17,150
Lil, Koko's gonna come over and
stay with you while I'm gone, okay?

238
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:19,762
And put those books back in
there when you're done, I mean it.

239
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,707
- Ready?
- Yeah.

240
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:25,245
Hey... the door.

241
00:15:25,828 --> 00:15:26,515
Sorry.

242
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,439
- Shut up.
- I swear.

243
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:37,318
Jean jackets are out?
How is that possible?

244
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:39,264
I just opened the
magazine and there it was.

245
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:41,046
This is horrible. Who
decides these things?

246
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,396
Marie Claire, apparently.

247
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,600
I feel so helpless.

248
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,314
Did you hear? Jean jackets are out.

249
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,482
- Out of where?
- Vogue.

250
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,515
- No, Marie Claire.
- Whatever. We still can't wear them.

251
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:52,801
You guys, thank you so much for
passing out the yearbooks for me.

252
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,246
- I really need the study time.
- No problem.

253
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,957
Do you want me to at least
help you bring the boxes in?

254
00:15:56,252 --> 00:15:57,933
Oh, we've got that taken care of.

255
00:15:58,187 --> 00:15:59,161
Halfway through.

256
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:01,020
Yeah, hurry up, 'cause
we need to get started.

257
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,912
God, he carries those boxes sexy.

258
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:05,971
Hello?

259
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,937
Rory, you haven't returned my calls.

260
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:10,747
Oh, Grandma, I'm so sorry.
I've been really busy.

261
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,539
I don't care how busy
you get, young lady,

262
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:14,151
you have to call your grandmother back.

263
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:16,271
- I'm sorry.
- I won't be around forever, you know.

264
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,391
- I'm really sorry.
- When are you coming over?

265
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:21,428
I need to discuss what to wear to your
graduation. I thought about a suit.

266
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,743
- A suit seems nice.
- But perhaps it's too formal.

267
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:24,659
Formal's fine.

268
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,165
What are your friends' families wearing?

269
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:27,039
I don't know.

270
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,020
- Can you find out?
- Sure, hold on.

271
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,071
Louise, what's your grandmother
wearing to graduation?

272
00:16:33,354 --> 00:16:35,645
Hopefully the pearls
I get when she kicks.

273
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:40,073
- Why don't I just come over?
- Oh, that would be wonderful. Today?

274
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:41,788
Yes, as soon as I can get away.

275
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,716
And bring a color swatch of your
cap and gown so I don't clash.

276
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:45,613
Bye, Grandma.

277
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:48,956
Hello?

278
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,747
- I just got another call from Grandma.
- Rory, no.

279
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,934
- I'm gonna go over there now.
- And leave me here alone?

280
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:55,341
Where are you? I can't even see you.

281
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,943
I'm over here by the Old Spice ad.

282
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,587
- Hi.
- Hi. Come over.

283
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,514
I have to go.

284
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,312
You can't come over
and talk for one second?

285
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:04,055
The minute I walk into that room, I'm
suddenly gonna have to sign yearbooks,

286
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:05,729
and since I'm severely
crunched for time,

287
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,670
I'm gonna have to resort
to classic clams like,

288
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:10,999
"Hey, have a good summer. Let's
keep in touch. Best friends forever,"

289
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,370
and I do not wanna be that person.

290
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:15,391
Plus, Paris will immediately shanghai
me and give me a million things to do.

291
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:18,330
You know what, you need to stop
being intimidated by that girl.

292
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,779
You're going to college for God's sake.

293
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:23,296
You need to be able to stand up for
yourself and say, you know, "Paris, go... "

294
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:25,135
What are you doing?

295
00:17:25,298 --> 00:17:28,770
I was just... the phone rang...
your hair is really shiny.

296
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:31,365
We're not even set up yet. The box
isn't out, the tickets aren't in order.

297
00:17:31,524 --> 00:17:34,523
- Where's the list?
- It's... in my purse.

298
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:37,250
Well, terrific. I can't think of a
better place for the list to be except,

299
00:17:37,346 --> 00:17:39,768
oh, maybe out here on the table
where we could actually look at it.

300
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:42,108
Your hair is really shiny.

301
00:17:42,246 --> 00:17:43,976
I'm going to go make the
rounds. I'll be back in a minute.

302
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:45,477
- Have you seen Rory?
- No.

303
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:46,629
I'll go look outside.

304
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:48,902
Run, run, run!

305
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:51,005
Okay, I'm gonna be at Grandma's for
about an hour. Can you pick me up?

306
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,479
If Paris hasn't had me flogged,
then yes, I'll be there.

307
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:54,474
Thank you. Bye.

308
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,232
Please, God, tell me I
didn't forget the list.

309
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,659
So the kid in the bookcase back there...

310
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:01,440
- Lily.
- Is she yours?

311
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:03,576
Mine, yes. Not Jimmy's.

312
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:06,166
I was married for the longest
minute and a half in the world and...

313
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,149
- Hey sweetie, how's everything?
- Everything's fine.

314
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:09,966
I love that. Give Riley a kiss.

315
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,924
Then I came to my senses and ran for
the hills but I got Lily so I win, ha ha.

316
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,921
Short cut.

317
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:18,793
Anyhow, I met Jimmy about
five and a half years ago,

318
00:18:18,936 --> 00:18:20,595
but Lily's just crazy about him, so...

319
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,449
Ronnie, I found your keys again.

320
00:18:22,664 --> 00:18:24,364
Oh, good. Thank you, baby doll.

321
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:27,181
You have got to sew that hole
in your pocket up, I mean it.

322
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:28,635
Today, drop your coat by my house.

323
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:30,385
I'll do it for you if
you don't have the time.

324
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:32,966
- Got any brothers or sisters?
- Apparently not.

325
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:37,528
Lily submitted a written request for
a brother by the end of this year,

326
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:40,221
but I think I should be
married before we have any kids.

327
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:41,384
You guys aren't married.

328
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,615
- You didn't know that.
- No.

329
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,383
- You guys had quite a talk, didn't you?
- Yeah, well.

330
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:51,096
Okay, we're here.

331
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:56,806
- Well.
- It looks like a jar of pickles.

332
00:18:56,912 --> 00:18:59,789
I know it's a jar of pickles,
but is it that jar of pickles?

333
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:01,045
- Yes.
- You're sure.

334
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:01,991
No.

335
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:05,386
Look, the Chicago dills were the original
pickles they sold here back in 1922.

336
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:07,107
1922. Yes, I listen.

337
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:09,399
Now I finally tracked down
the family that sold them,

338
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:12,309
I paid a substantial premium
to use the original labels,

339
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:13,662
I waited weeks for them to arrive,

340
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,073
and now they're here and I look at
them and they don't look the same.

341
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,257
Too many bumps.

342
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,049
Jimmy, I'm begging you, play golf.

343
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,788
Just call the guy and tell them
they look different, please.

344
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:22,960
Whatever you say.

345
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:25,003
Jimmy.

346
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:26,226
Hey Sash.

347
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,969
- You have a visitor.
- Yeah?

348
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,953
- You... just get here?
- Just got here.

349
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:42,624
So, Jess, I assume you'll
be staying for dinner?

350
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,555
- Oh, well...
- Yeah, sure, stay.

351
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,972
You'll stay. He'll stay.
We'll get Abbott's, right?

352
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,170
Whatever you want.

353
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:53,117
Well, I have to get back, so...

354
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,145
I will see you guys later.

355
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:02,543
Sorry I didn't call.

356
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,592
Hey, life's about the
spontaneous, right?

357
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:07,648
- This your place?
- The Inferno... yes.

358
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:09,036
- It's nice.
- Thanks.

359
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:14,021
Hey, why don't I come out there?

360
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:15,528
Oh, I didn't mean to
interrupt your work.

361
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,714
No problem. Hey Lee, I'm
gonna take a break for awhile.

362
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,834
Thank God.

363
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,708
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's fine.

364
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,350
- So, first time on the West Coast?
- First time on the West Coast.

365
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:36,443
The sites.

366
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:39,054
Ocean.

367
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:40,973
- I wondered what that was.
- Sand.

368
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:43,259
- Keeps the ocean in its place.
- Sky.

369
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:44,876
We've got one of those back east.

370
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,145
And then you have the boardwalk.

371
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:50,134
Sunglasses, smoothies, bootlegged CD's.

372
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,350
- Good ones?
- Not bad, I guess.

373
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,671
I never actually bought
one. My neighbor Stan did.

374
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:57,317
He's not my neighbor anymore.
He used to work at Lockheed,

375
00:20:57,394 --> 00:21:00,789
but they shut down the Burbank plant, so
he went to a trade school out in the valley.

376
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,289
He installs cable now.

377
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,497
Sends me a postcard at Christmas time.

378
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:06,283
He's Dutch.

379
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:11,500
Currently, we're in Santa Monica.

380
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:14,992
You keep walking, you hit Venice
- that's technically where we live.

381
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:17,175
Past that, you got Marina Del Rey -

382
00:21:17,587 --> 00:21:19,067
lotta bike shots in that area.

383
00:21:19,462 --> 00:21:22,454
And then you're getting near the beaches
- Manhattan, Redondo,

384
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,976
- and basically that's it.
- That's it. That's all of LA.

385
00:21:26,247 --> 00:21:28,854
There are these crazy rumors
that if you get in your car

386
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,059
and you actually drive
east away from the beach,

387
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:34,219
there's some city and other stuff,
but personally I don't believe it.

388
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:35,632
I take it you like the beach.

389
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,648
I would marry the beach if man
and property were allowed to mate.

390
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,641
Sounds serious.

391
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,859
I've lived a lot of places
all over this country,

392
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:44,756
and nothing, absolutely
nothing, compares to this.

393
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,480
So where else have you lived?

394
00:21:47,997 --> 00:21:49,793
What, where else? Let's see.

395
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,412
Minneapolis, Chicago, Biloxi, Maine -

396
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:53,833
- worked on a lobster boat.
- Yeah?

397
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:56,016
Yeah. Let me tell you, I smelled great.

398
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,078
- Did a stint in New Jersey, New Hampshire...
- New York?

399
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:03,978
Oh, yeah, well, obviously, New York.

400
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,907
New York was...

401
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:07,474
well...

402
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:11,129
You know what New York was, so...

403
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:13,373
- Jimmy?
- Yeah?

404
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,450
I didn't come here to
bust your balls, man.

405
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:17,571
Okay, good to know.

406
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,020
Jimmy, I got the pickle guy.
He's as worried about you as I am.

407
00:22:22,537 --> 00:22:23,315
I should take this.

408
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,793
- Go ahead. I can just hang out.
- You sure?

409
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:28,995
- I got my book, I'm good.
- Okay, you're good.

410
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,616
Hi, I'm here to see my grandmother.

411
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:45,675
She's in the living
room with Miss Celine.

412
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:47,446
- With who?
- Right this way.

413
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:50,984
- It's stunning.
- Really?

414
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:52,822
Chills, I've got chills.

415
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:53,846
Turn for me, dear.

416
00:22:54,532 --> 00:22:56,755
Oh, it moves, it just moves.

417
00:22:57,298 --> 00:23:01,296
Ginger Rogers always insisted
her dresses move just like that.

418
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:03,153
Ginger Rogers, well.

419
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:05,131
Of course, she didn't have your legs.

420
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,148
- Oh, Celine.
- Hey, Grandma.

421
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:09,889
Rory, perfect. What do you think?

422
00:23:10,168 --> 00:23:11,080
You look beautiful.

423
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:13,542
If I do, it's all
because of this lady here.

424
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:15,382
Rory, I'd like you to meet Miss Celine.

425
00:23:15,642 --> 00:23:17,783
She's been our fashion
consultant for years.

426
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,214
- Oh, well, how do you...
- Oh my God, it's Audrey Hepburn.

427
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:22,016
What?

428
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,377
You're Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina.

429
00:23:24,602 --> 00:23:27,956
- Just a waif with eyes.
- Thank you.

430
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,264
Celine, I don't think the
handkerchief works with this.

431
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:31,838
Oh, Rory, I didn't know you were here.

432
00:23:32,026 --> 00:23:34,074
Richard, look at this
girl, what do you see?

433
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:37,042
- Well...
- It's Audrey Hepburn in Sabrina.

434
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,689
Now that you mention it, there
is a touch of Audrey in her.

435
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:41,061
But even prettier.

436
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:43,991
Yes, without that
ridiculous affected accent.

437
00:23:44,158 --> 00:23:47,765
For years I kept telling her,
"Audrey, get a speech therapist. "

438
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:49,586
She was very stubborn.

439
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:51,942
But could she wear capris.

440
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,599
You know, Rory is
starting Yale in the fall.

441
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:57,190
Yale, that is exciting.

442
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:59,730
You'll need a whole new wardrobe, huh?

443
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,725
Oh, Celine, I love this one.

444
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:08,448
Yes, I had that exact suit made in mint
for Mrs. Walter Cronkite just last week.

445
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,594
A darling woman.

446
00:24:10,937 --> 00:24:13,016
We've been friends since the Big Bang.

447
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:14,250
That's nice.

448
00:24:14,563 --> 00:24:15,725
What do you think of this, Richard?

449
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:19,601
I like the green one with the beads.
It made you look like a mermaid.

450
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:22,171
But you guys know that this
is just a casual graduation.

451
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,558
Folding chairs on the grass.

452
00:24:24,137 --> 00:24:26,605
- There's going to be grass?
- Yeah, it's going to be outside.

453
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:28,986
Oh, you cannot wear green around grass.

454
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:32,641
I learned that from Tova
Borgnine the hard way.

455
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:36,414
Go try the red one on. Red
goes wonderful with nature.

456
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:38,452
- All right.
- I'm gonna try the grey linen.

457
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:43,056
- Ah, yes, with this white silk shirt.
- Oh, very nice.

458
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:48,252
Yes, I had that exact shirt on Jimmy
Stewart the night before his colonoscopy.

459
00:24:48,385 --> 00:24:50,864
He came through it clean as a whistle.

460
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:58,692
Never underestimate the
power of a good shirt.

461
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:00,878
I never will again.

462
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,271
- Kathy Kim.
- Check.

463
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,489
Next.

464
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,490
Greg Agulara.

465
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:11,083
Check.

466
00:25:12,937 --> 00:25:13,479
Next.

467
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:15,792
Brad Langford.

468
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,477
Check.

469
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:21,923
Why did you do that?

470
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:24,589
It has a really bad picture of us on it.

471
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,843
Yeah, but that page had the only
picture of me in the entire book.

472
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,214
There.

473
00:25:31,942 --> 00:25:32,412
Next.

474
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:34,148
No one is going to buy our tickets.

475
00:25:34,728 --> 00:25:36,003
Give it time, Paris.

476
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:38,459
We've been sitting here for an
hour and have sold eight tickets.

477
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,737
Grad Night is a big deal, Paris.

478
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,095
They will buy the tickets.

479
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:44,435
Unbutton your top.

480
00:25:45,499 --> 00:25:45,874
What?

481
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:48,060
Teenage boys are controlled by
one thing. Unbutton your top.

482
00:25:49,518 --> 00:25:50,820
Well, me doing it
isn't going to help any.

483
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:52,642
Paris, you need to relax.

484
00:25:52,847 --> 00:25:54,782
You need to stop worrying.
You need to stop obsessing.

485
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,374
You need to stop looking at my boobs.

486
00:25:56,564 --> 00:26:00,223
Fine. Oh, man, even the stupid
class poster table has a line.

487
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:02,532
Okay, time to play "Let's
distract Paris. " Look at me.

488
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,046
- Let's talk.
- About what?

489
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:07,775
Anything. Tell me what
college you finally landed on.

490
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:09,444
- I didn't.
- What's it between?

491
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:13,065
- Princeton, Columbia, and Yale.
- Good choices.

492
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,051
I'm really not that
interested in Columbia,

493
00:26:15,234 --> 00:26:17,309
but the thought of me going
there horrifies my mother

494
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:18,927
so I have to keep it
in the mix, you know?

495
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:20,247
Do I ever.

496
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:22,613
Princeton's a good school,
but Jamie goes there.

497
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:23,570
- That's your boyfriend?
- Yes.

498
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:27,569
He goes there, and if I go there, it's going
to look like I went there just to be with him.

499
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:31,732
Suddenly I'm Felicity without the hair issues
and I'm not terribly comfortable with that.

500
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:33,887
But look at it like this -

501
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:37,220
not going to a school you wanna go to
just because your boyfriend is there

502
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:39,657
is just as bad as going to a
school you don't wanna go to

503
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,618
- just because your boyfriend isn't there.
- I guess.

504
00:26:41,818 --> 00:26:43,509
If you wanna go to
Princeton, go to Princeton.

505
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:45,378
If you wanna go to Yale, go to Yale.

506
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:47,759
Leave Jamie out of it.
Leave your mother out of it.

507
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:52,050
Just decide whatever it
is you wanna do and do it.

508
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,400
I can try that, I guess.

509
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,452
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

510
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,826
What are you doing?

511
00:27:00,761 --> 00:27:02,816
- I'm giving you a hug.
- Why?

512
00:27:03,703 --> 00:27:06,692
Just give into it, baby. Come
on, you can do it. That a girl.

513
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:11,880
Unclench the fists, Paris. Unclench
the fists. Yeah, there you go.

514
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:13,409
Sash, I'm home!

515
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:17,946
What's up, Lily-Lou?

516
00:27:18,188 --> 00:27:19,369
Want some pineapple on your pizza?

517
00:27:19,528 --> 00:27:20,449
- Yes.
- Yes.

518
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:22,411
- Does she do that a lot?
- All the time.

519
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:23,839
- You ever find it a little weird?
- All the time.

520
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:27,423
Listen, why don't you
give me a minute here.

521
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:30,444
Make it two, two minutes.

522
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:34,388
Three, and do a special knock
before you come in, maybe a -

523
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:36,701
I'll tell you what, I passed a
bookstore back on the boardwalk,

524
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:38,188
why don't I just go
check it out for awhile?

525
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:40,599
Okay. But I thought the
knock idea was kind of cool.

526
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:59,962
So, last week when you said
you were going to Sacramento

527
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:02,727
to check out a potential
supplier, you actually went...

528
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,250
To Connecticut to see Jess.

529
00:28:04,713 --> 00:28:06,771
That was quite an
elaborate story you made up.

530
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:09,029
- I do have a gift.
- Of course I didn't believe you.

531
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:11,748
- Okay, it's not a big gift, but...
- Why didn't you tell me?

532
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:13,679
I don't know.

533
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,744
You're nodding your head.
Why are you nodding your head?

534
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:19,598
You're shrugging your shoulders.

535
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:21,538
You're nodding your head
and shrugging your shoulders.

536
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:24,286
Why are you nodding your head
and shrugging your shoulders?

537
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:26,909
Will you stop nodding your head
and shrugging your shoulders?

538
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,731
- Sasha, come on.
- I'm gonna pick up the pizza.

539
00:28:28,837 --> 00:28:29,484
Just have it delivered.

540
00:28:29,592 --> 00:28:32,484
The delivery guys are too stoned after
six to find the house, it'll take forever.

541
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:34,292
I didn't know how it was gonna go, okay?

542
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:35,673
I didn't know if he
was even gonna be there

543
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,993
or if he was gonna wanna
talk to me or slug me or -

544
00:28:38,086 --> 00:28:38,813
- I get it.
- Sash.

545
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:40,881
- I'll see you later, roomie.
- Do not do that.

546
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:44,419
We are not roomies. We are
partners, we're soul mates.

547
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:47,240
You just traveled cross-country
to see your son for the first time

548
00:28:47,321 --> 00:28:50,174
since he was born and you
didn't tell me. We are roomies.

549
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:51,787
I'm sorry.

550
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:54,250
Get the extra mattress
out of the closet.

551
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:55,801
- What for?
- For Jess.

552
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:58,018
- For Jess to do what?
- For Jess to sleep on.

553
00:28:58,197 --> 00:28:59,841
- Jess is sleeping here?
- Isn't he?

554
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:00,809
I don't know.

555
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:03,076
Jimmy, you didn't ask him
if he's staying the night?

556
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:05,447
Did you ask him how long he's here for?

557
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,184
- Did you ask him anything?
- Should I have?

558
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:08,679
Jimmy, he could be in trouble.

559
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,157
What, he's in trouble?
What kind of trouble?

560
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,535
How would I know what kind of trouble?

561
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:12,917
You're the one that just
said he was in trouble.

562
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,279
I said he could be in trouble.

563
00:29:14,443 --> 00:29:18,109
He could be running from the cops, or
attempting to hop across America on one foot,

564
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:20,993
or he really did come all
the way from Connecticut

565
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:25,369
just to have pizza with his father who he's
not seen or heard from in seventeen years.

566
00:29:26,706 --> 00:29:28,073
What are the odds it's the last one?

567
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,834
Do what you want. Talk to him, don't
talk to him, I am not your mother.

568
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,620
I don't care. I'll be
back. Lily, come on.

569
00:29:44,355 --> 00:29:49,061
Now, Sabrina, college is a very
important time in a young girl's life.

570
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:52,650
- You need to be properly attired.
- I'm sure, but...

571
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:58,435
Trust me, a young girl is completely
and solely judged by her appearance.

572
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:03,227
All right, let's begin. I always
start every wardrobe from the top.

573
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:05,117
The hat.

574
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:08,797
Remember Sabrina, it's the
first thing that God sees

575
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:10,513
when you walk outside in the morning.

576
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:14,240
Well, I'm exhausted. I feel as if
I've tried on every dress in town.

577
00:30:14,336 --> 00:30:15,148
So is it the blue?

578
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:16,994
Yes, I think it's the blue.

579
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:19,724
I think it's quite suitable for
my granddaughter's graduation.

580
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:21,823
- Hey. Hi hon, hi Mom.
- Hey.

581
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,026
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to pick Rory up.

582
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:28,551
- Miss Celine.
- Oh my God, it's Natalie Wood!

583
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,787
Look Sabrina, it's Natalie Wood.

584
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:34,792
Oh, Miss Celine, I can't believe
it, you're still... working.

585
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,175
Oh, I tried to retire once.

586
00:30:37,354 --> 00:30:39,498
Olivia deHavilland wouldn't hear of it.

587
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,626
How are you? How's Mrs. Walter Cronkite.

588
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:45,479
Lovely. Thank you for asking, Natalie.

589
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,757
I left the suits upstairs.
I'll just go up and get them.

590
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:49,596
No, I'll get them.

591
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:53,131
It's who I am, the
keeper of the clothes.

592
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:56,764
- Delight to see you again.
- Same here, Celine.

593
00:30:57,928 --> 00:31:03,441
Oh my God, she was like a thousand
when I was ten, I can't believe it.

594
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,683
You should've seen all the clothes
that Grandma tried on today.

595
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:08,709
She picked out a beautiful
blue dress for graduation.

596
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:10,773
I'd like to see that, Mom.

597
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:12,361
It needs to be altered.

598
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,027
Oh, sure. I'll see it
at graduation, I guess.

599
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:21,516
So I'm sorry I didn't give you
advanced notice that I was coming over.

600
00:31:21,844 --> 00:31:23,390
I don't need advanced notice, Lorelai.

601
00:31:23,564 --> 00:31:24,726
Okay, you just seem tense.

602
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,262
No, I'm just tired.

603
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,102
And busy. I have a very
busy evening ahead of me.

604
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:30,532
Oh, I'm sure you do.

605
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:33,344
- Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore.
- No, it's not.

606
00:31:33,485 --> 00:31:35,666
- I just checked it and it's...
- I was in there ten minutes ago

607
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:38,801
- and it still had another forty minutes to go.
- But it's really brown and...

608
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:41,530
Lupe, please do not argue
with me. It's not ready.

609
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,111
Now go in there and make the salad.

610
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:47,254
- What?
- The salad's ready.

611
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:48,103
Lupe!

612
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:51,765
Mom, it's seven o'clock.

613
00:31:52,404 --> 00:31:53,921
- So?
- That's your dinnertime.

614
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:57,156
- I don't have a dinnertime, Lorelai.
- You don't have a dinnertime?

615
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:58,120
No, I don't.

616
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:00,407
So all the years I
grew up in this house,

617
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:04,130
we did not sit down to dinner at
exactly seven o'clock every single night?

618
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:05,968
- No.
- I just imagined that?

619
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:09,152
Lorelai, I don't know what your
obsession with dinnertime is.

620
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:11,631
My obsession with dinnertime is
that it was always at seven o'clock,

621
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:14,042
now all of a sudden, it's
not. Is it because I'm here?

622
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,588
- That's ridiculous.
- It is.

623
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:18,392
I'm here, and if you served dinner,

624
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:21,215
Miss Manners would insist that you
invite me to stay and you don't want to,

625
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:25,111
so you're going to pretend that dinner
is suddenly whenever you feel like it.

626
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,775
Lorelai, do not get dramatic.

627
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:31,804
Dinner is not ready, and even if it was, I
would still not be able to invite you to stay

628
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:33,848
because your father and
I have plans tonight.

629
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:35,762
We are eating quickly and then leaving.

630
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:36,851
To go where?

631
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:38,828
- The Thompsons.
- For what?

632
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:40,764
- Book club.
- What book?

633
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:42,777
- Lovely Bones.
- Did you like it?

634
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:46,058
It's not my taste but
I respect the attempt.

635
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:47,840
Now I know where I get it from.

636
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:49,350
We'll have dinner
another time, all right?

637
00:32:49,847 --> 00:32:51,863
So, are you kicking us out?

638
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,101
I told you, we have plans.

639
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:56,165
Or do you just wanna get that
dinner of yours that's been ready

640
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,307
for ten minutes now on the table?

641
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,259
Lorelai, please.

642
00:32:58,448 --> 00:33:01,858
Tell me this
- if I couldn't stay but Rory could, would you want her to?

643
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,772
Of course I would, but as I told
you, your father and I have plans.

644
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,649
So she can't stay even if I'm gone?

645
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:08,704
No, she can't.

646
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:12,411
Emily, for heaven's sake, it's
7:10. Why aren't we eating?

647
00:33:12,544 --> 00:33:16,277
Oh, hi, Dad. Listen, Rory was gonna stay
for dinner if you guys don't have plans.

648
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,735
Of course we don't have any plans.

649
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,953
Oh, I'm thrilled, Rory is staying.

650
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:23,173
You just livened up a very
boring night in the Gilmore house.

651
00:33:23,649 --> 00:33:24,893
Enjoy your dinner.

652
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:26,898
And Mom, get yourself an agent

653
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:29,945
'cause you're wasting that
talent of yours in dinner theater.

654
00:33:30,237 --> 00:33:31,009
Mom, wait.

655
00:33:37,738 --> 00:33:41,201
Mom, wait. Where are you going?

656
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,848
I'm gonna drive in a
circle backwards really fast

657
00:33:43,944 --> 00:33:46,689
to reverse the Earth's orbit
to go back in time to before

658
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:48,902
I made the insane decision to
come here in the first place.

659
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,153
- You came here to pick me up.
- What was I thinking doing that?

660
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:52,920
You were thinking, 'Hey, wouldn't
it be great for my daughter

661
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,988
not to have to walk all the
way back to Stars Hollow. '

662
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,631
A thirty-mile hike never hurt
anyone. God, I can't believe her.

663
00:33:57,754 --> 00:33:59,115
- And I can't believe you.
- Why?

664
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,615
- You were gonna leave me here?
- So you could have dinner with them.

665
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:03,780
I never said I wanted
to have dinner with them.

666
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,899
You said I wanted to have dinner
with them, and then you stormed out.

667
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:10,360
Okay, I'm sorry. I just, I finally
realized that I can't do this anymore.

668
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:12,474
I can't come back
here anymore, I'm done.

669
00:34:12,642 --> 00:34:14,798
I'm sorry. I never should've
asked you to pick me up.

670
00:34:14,865 --> 00:34:16,027
It's okay. It's good, actually.

671
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:19,008
Now I can stop feeling guilty
for not talking to them.

672
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:21,157
I can go back to the
way things were before.

673
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:22,612
We share a nose and that's it.

674
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,675
- So we're going?
- Yes, we're going.

675
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,030
Okay, I have to go get my books.
Please be here when I come back.

676
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:40,137
- Are you staying?
- No, I have to go, Grandma.

677
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:43,087
All right, I guess we'll just
see you at graduation then.

678
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:43,901
I guess you will.

679
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:47,526
I swear, I don't know what to do with
that mother of yours, I really don't.

680
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,944
Everything has to be such a scene.

681
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:50,848
I think you're being really stupid.

682
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:02,590
- So, Souplantation...
- Hang on, I'm almost at the end of this chapter.

683
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,598
Okay, let the raving begin.

684
00:35:06,824 --> 00:35:08,498
A room full of all you can eat food.

685
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:10,929
Soup, salad, pizza,
pasta, chicken wings,

686
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,727
ice cream, rainbow sprinkles.

687
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,661
How did I not know about
the rainbow sprinkles?

688
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,914
- I have no good answers for you.
- We are going back with Tupperware.

689
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:20,172
- It's turning yellow.
- Ah, shoot.

690
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,979
- Come on, gun it.
- I can't.

691
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:23,091
Mom, we have to get home.

692
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:25,552
Rory, I already have two
tickets. I cannot get another.

693
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,337
Oh, I can't believe you stopped.

694
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:29,576
I can't believe you wanted me to go.

695
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:30,668
There's no one around.

696
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:33,489
Now no one's around, but
the second I run that light,

697
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:37,677
a police car, four helicopters, the
Canadian mounties and the crew of Cops

698
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:40,022
- jump out of a dumpster and I'm toast.
- Paranoid.

699
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:42,997
Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean
they're not out to get you, my friend.

700
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,740
All right, I guess we wait.

701
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:54,426
Do you think Luke will know
we went to Souplantation?

702
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:55,730
Not unless you tell him.

703
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:58,167
But maybe he'll be able
to tell. They'll be a glow.

704
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,231
An all-you-can-eat
glow.

705
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:03,078
He'll see the glow, he'll know we cheated,
and he'll never give us extra fries again.

706
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:12,780
Mom, why did just bolt away from us?

707
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:15,145
Maybe he saw the glow.

708
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:16,689
Mom.

709
00:36:17,997 --> 00:36:20,568
Okay, first of all, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

710
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:25,376
I just thought with all the stuff
you were doing, maybe I should wait.

711
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:26,477
What's going on?

712
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:29,297
Jess is gone.

713
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:31,930
- Gone where?
- I don't know.

714
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:34,690
Luke knows, but he didn't tell me.

715
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:38,827
But he doesn't seem to
think he's coming back.

716
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:42,052
Neither do I.

717
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:47,700
Are you okay?

718
00:36:49,554 --> 00:36:50,192
Yeah.

719
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:52,993
Forget this.

720
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:21,123
Hey, when you say 'I'm going to check
out a bookstore on the boardwalk',

721
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:22,490
- you be more specific.
- What?

722
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,410
I have been wandering
around for over an hour.

723
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:25,854
I've been to three different bookstores.

724
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,086
I have been worried sick
about you, you hear me?

725
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:29,305
- Sorry.
- Outside.

726
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,345
- But...
- Outside.

727
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,808
- Are you in trouble?
- What?

728
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,574
You know, when you left
home, were the cops after you?

729
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,625
No 'cause they shouldn't be or no
'cause they haven't found the head yet?

730
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:48,024
What's up, Jimmy?

731
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:50,671
- You just showed up here, man.
- I know I did.

732
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,166
No call, no letter, just like...

733
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:54,896
Just like you showed up in Stars
Hollow with no letter, no call.

734
00:37:54,992 --> 00:37:57,706
- Were you in trouble?
- We're not talking about me, we're talking about you.

735
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,524
- I'm not running from the cops.
- Then why are you here?

736
00:37:59,601 --> 00:38:00,507
Why'd you come to Stars Hollow?

737
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,688
Hey, listen, Mr. Double-Talk,
I need an answer here.

738
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,502
Well, so do I.

739
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:05,858
You show up, you don't talk
to me, you don't say anything.

740
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:07,454
You just have a cup of
coffee, then you left.

741
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,606
Why'd you come if you
didn't even wanna talk to me?

742
00:38:09,713 --> 00:38:11,320
- I did wanna talk to you.
- You did?

743
00:38:11,392 --> 00:38:12,672
Of course I wanted to talk to you.

744
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:15,789
You think a person travels all the way across
the country just to listen to a Bowie song?

745
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:18,013
Granted, a classic off Ziggy, but still.

746
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,525
So, what, you're telling
me you just chickened out?

747
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:21,530
Yeah.

748
00:38:27,863 --> 00:38:30,187
- Well, I came to see you.
- Okay.

749
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:33,751
And I thought maybe I could
crash here for a little while.

750
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:37,300
Just a little while.

751
00:38:37,786 --> 00:38:42,296
I don't need my own room or anything.
I can just sleep on the couch.

752
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:44,549
Or the extra mattress
we keep in the closet.

753
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,372
Sure, that'd be fine, too.

754
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,030
You know, Sasha's always right.

755
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,602
It drives me crazy. No matter what
the situation, she's always right.

756
00:38:50,918 --> 00:38:51,462
Jimmy.

757
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:53,799
I'd love to be right just
once in awhile, you know?

758
00:38:53,886 --> 00:38:54,834
It wouldn't be for long.

759
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,788
Do you know she called the
Super Bowl five times in a row?

760
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,238
Who does that? What is she, a witch?

761
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:00,419
You know what, say no if you want.

762
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:03,011
- Jess, man, come on, you can't stay here.
- Why not?

763
00:39:03,117 --> 00:39:03,896
- 'Cause you can't.
- Why not?

764
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:04,940
- 'Cause you can't.
- Why not?

765
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:05,917
Because you can't.

766
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:10,325
I'd ask "why not" but it doesn't
seem to be getting me anywhere.

767
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,963
Look at me, Jess. I'm not a father.

768
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:15,836
I was never a father. I left
you because I wasn't a father.

769
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:18,826
I mean it, the minute the cigar was finished,
I was like, "What the hell are you doing?

770
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:21,360
You can't take care of yourself. How
are you gonna take care of someone else?"

771
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:23,878
- That's not why...
- I can't take you in, I can't raise you.

772
00:39:24,043 --> 00:39:26,244
Raise me? I'm eighteen! I'm raised.

773
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:27,570
I can vote, I can be drafted.

774
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:30,750
It's a little late to throw me a Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtle birthday party.

775
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:32,225
I thought you didn't come
here to bust my balls.

776
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:34,026
- I didn't.
- Well, then put the bat down, man.

777
00:39:34,135 --> 00:39:37,570
I don't need a daddy. I
just need a place to crash.

778
00:39:37,702 --> 00:39:39,926
Do you even understand that it's
only been the last five years

779
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:41,938
that I've even started
to put my life together?

780
00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:43,258
You don't wanna be around me.

781
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:45,860
I am a screw-up. That
is my genetic code.

782
00:39:46,146 --> 00:39:48,477
the apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

783
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:49,434
Don't say that.

784
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,261
You're young, you can
do anything you want.

785
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:53,350
A month. Just let me stay a month.

786
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:56,120
Are you listening? I have
nothing to offer you. Nothing.

787
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:59,238
You have nothing? I have nothing!

788
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:02,797
I have no place to go. I can't stay at
Luke's, I can't stay in Stars Hollow.

789
00:40:02,919 --> 00:40:04,292
My mother is a wackjob.

790
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,083
I mean, you're saying
you're this loser and what,

791
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:09,027
you don't wanna take me off this
terrific path I'm headed down right now?

792
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,116
I'm not graduating high school.

793
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:13,165
I don't know what I'm gonna
do with the rest of my life,

794
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:15,106
but something's telling
me I better find out soon

795
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:18,397
or I'm gonna be that guy out there on
the boardwalk selling the hemp hats.

796
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:25,253
I have one of those.

797
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:27,552
It's a good hat.

798
00:40:34,376 --> 00:40:35,016
Well?

799
00:40:37,198 --> 00:40:38,528
I have to talk it over with Sasha.

800
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,596
Just tell her I'm a dog.

801
00:40:42,277 --> 00:40:42,974
Great idea.

802
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:46,619
Maybe you can sit there and lick yourself
while she decides, you know, help sell it.

803
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:50,105
Thank you, Jimmy.

804
00:40:51,436 --> 00:40:53,137
If she says it's okay, then we'll see.

805
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:55,159
- Fine, we'll see.
- It may not work out.

806
00:40:55,308 --> 00:40:56,337
I totally understand.

807
00:40:56,435 --> 00:40:59,788
But I'll ask and if she says
it's okay, then we'll see.

808
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:02,317
We'll see.

809
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,525
Oh my God, I'm so tired.

810
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:12,209
Here's a crazy thought,
how about going to bed?

811
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:13,141
I have to study.

812
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,484
Or, better yet, make a pot of coffee and
once again, get no sleep. Just as good.

813
00:41:19,055 --> 00:41:20,417
- What's this?
- Oh, that's just...

814
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:22,782
Yale needed my Social
Security number for something.

815
00:41:26,704 --> 00:41:29,478
- Look who became a soche.
- What?

816
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:31,660
You have a lot of signatures
in here, little girl.

817
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:34,815
Everybody signs everybody's
yearbook. It's polite.

818
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:38,311
"Rory, have a great
summer. BFF. Amber. "

819
00:41:38,721 --> 00:41:41,849
- Hey, Amber BFF'ed you.
- Yeah, I feel truly blessed.

820
00:41:42,034 --> 00:41:44,188
"Hey, Aurory Borealis. "

821
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,375
Okay, can't talk to this one ever again.

822
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:50,729
"You have been my inspiration, my rock,
my light. I loved you in South Pacific. "

823
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:53,570
- When did you do South Pacific?
- What?

824
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:56,273
Some dipstick named Shauna
thinks you were in South Pacific.

825
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,474
Oh, Shauna tends to get people mixed up.

826
00:41:58,798 --> 00:41:59,591
Oh, okay.

827
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:10,773
Hey, you know what's weird?

828
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,505
A lot of the kids in here are
calling you a valedictorian.

829
00:42:15,647 --> 00:42:17,117
Is that anything like a dirty skank,

830
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,651
'cause if it is I'll kick their
plaid butts up and down the sidewalk.

831
00:42:22,052 --> 00:42:23,850
Were you named valedictorian?

832
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,709
Yes, and you know what that means?

833
00:42:25,867 --> 00:42:28,899
One more stupid speech that I have to
write, that I have no time to write,

834
00:42:28,996 --> 00:42:30,358
but nevertheless, I have to write.

835
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:31,367
Hey, listen,

836
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:35,171
my little Holly Hunter
in Broadcast News,

837
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:39,568
I'm gonna let you freak out
and study like a mad woman

838
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:41,473
and stress yourself out until finals,

839
00:42:41,668 --> 00:42:44,893
but once they're over, we are
gonna celebrate big time...

840
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,891
'cause this is amazing.

841
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:50,751
Yeah, it is.

842
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:57,192
Okay, now go make Mommy nervous.

843
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:58,549
