1
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,712
Previously on Gilmore Girls.;

2
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:05,214
- She's not here yet.
- All right.

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:07,382
You'll have to entertain me
until she arrives.

4
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:10,302
- Okay, burger boy, dance.
- Will you marry me?

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,721
- What?
- Looking for something to shut you up.

6
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,723
I actually thought
you'd like to go with me.

7
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:16,475
- You did not.
- I did, too.

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,228
- You did not, because you are not stupid.
- Why, thank you.

9
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,146
Slimy and weaselly, yes. But stupid, no.

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,565
He was totally nice to you
and you were a big jerk.

11
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,817
If you like Tristan so much,
you go out with him.

12
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,362
- What did you do?
- You wanted something festive.

13
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,198
- You made me a Santa burger.
- It's no big deal.

14
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,910
No one ever made me something
quite this disgusting before.

15
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,745
So you're the big, strong protector?

16
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,455
Little princess needs a protector.

17
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,998
- What's your problem, man?
- Nothing.

18
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,376
- Don't like your girlfriend.
- Doesn't look that way.

19
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,294
- Were you on a date?
- What?

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,630
- You have an escort.
- No, it's Luke.

21
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,924
Which is her way of saying
we weren't on a date.

22
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,342
I didn't mean it like that.

23
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,765
- You don't want to fight me, Tristan!
- Why not?

24
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,183
'Cause l'll kill you, idiot!

25
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,352
What exactly is going on
between the two of you?

26
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,603
We're friends, that's it.

27
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,480
You're idiots, the both of you.

28
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,898
He has a thing for you.

29
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:07,776
No, he doesn't.
It's just a game to him or something.

30
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,570
He has a thing for you.

31
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,948
He does nothing but insult me
and make me miserable.

32
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,867
He has a thing for you.

33
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,789
Absolutely nothing.

34
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,624
- Come on.
- I'm sorry. I'm looking.

35
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,669
- But there is nothing in here.
- You're kidding, right?

36
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,838
No, everything in here I wear.

37
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,591
- What?
- I do. There's nothing to give up.

38
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,719
The red-and-black halter top.

39
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,512
- No.
- Why?

40
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,472
It's a classic.

41
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,516
It's got rhinestones
and zebra stripes on it.

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,018
- So?
- Tassels.

43
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,603
- Yes.
- It has tassels, Mom.

44
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,938
Okay. I've had this since I was 17.

45
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,940
I'm sorry. Did I mention the tassels?

46
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,525
You're heartless and unsentimental.

47
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,860
You are a hopeless pack rat.

48
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:53,864
I don't understand why I have to uproot
my happy family of clothing, anyway.

49
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,657
Because it's a charity rummage sale.

50
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,201
- I know.
- That you helped organize.

51
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,911
- Okay.
- And volunteered to run.

52
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,705
It was very hot in that room that day.
I was dehydrated.

53
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,540
They could have talked me into anything.

54
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,791
- It was your idea.
- Okay.

55
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:08,378
I'm a very sick woman,
and that should be apparent to anyone.

56
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,797
Get out of the way.

57
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:14,593
- What are you doing?
- Step away from the closet, please.

58
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,762
This is so unfair.

59
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,931
No, not that whole chunk.

60
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,768
Okay, take that. That's ugly.
Just that one. No.

61
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,020
Now, all of this goes.

62
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,814
Come to this dresser, open the drawer,
and take out...

63
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,901
everything you'd be embarrassed
to be wearing in a car accident.

64
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,444
Meet me downstairs.

65
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,279
Move!

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

67
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,757
- Sweater.
- Over here.

68
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,179
- Jeans.
- In back of you.

69
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,892
A big, furry, purple thing
that could either be a hat...

70
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,477
a toilet paper cover,
or some kind of dirty hand puppet.

71
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,271
Mystery box on the left.

72
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,899
- Hey, Luke.
- Where do you want these?

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,569
- What do you have?
- Clothes, rags, some old pots and pans.

74
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:59,615
Kitchenware can go in the kitchen,
and the clothes right over there.

75
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,995
- Here, Grinch.
- Thank you.

76
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,955
- Who wants cheese?
- Are there crackers?

77
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,041
Somewhere in the state
of Connecticut, yes.

78
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,250
And in the Gilmore house?

79
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,544
- Who wants cheese?
- Me, please.

80
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,380
Kittens in the toilet poster?

81
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,799
- Another one?
- This one's signed.

82
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,887
There's a man in my kitchen!
Somebody call the constable.

83
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,015
- Your mom's a fruitcake.
- Fruitcakes by the door, please.

84
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,976
Goodbye, Rory.
I wish you luck with everything.

85
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,478
I appreciate that.

86
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,523
Okay, so rummage sale's Sunday.
Today's Tuesday.

87
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,609
At this rate we're going to be sleeping
in the yard by Thursday.

88
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,028
We've got to get this stuff
out of the living room.

89
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,613
- Hello.
- Go away.

90
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,031
I have a full set of dishes.

91
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,117
- Come on in, Taylor.
- Dishes in the kitchen, please.

92
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,495
Okay, but I have
to explain something first.

93
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,832
- Fine, go ahead.
- The butter dish has a small chip in it.

94
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,667
- Safety tip. Got it.
- It's fine.

95
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,004
I filed down the chip. If you place it
strategically on the table, nobody'll know.

96
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:00,592
Taylor, would you like to write
an instruction manual for the dishes?

97
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,136
- Could I?
- Notepad's in the kitchen.

98
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,851
That's nice.

99
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,313
- Put that back.
- But it has rhinestones on it.

100
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,733
The point of this is to get crap out,
not trade it in for new crap.

101
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,236
- Are you seeing this?
- Yes, I am.

102
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
I don't think you are,
because if you were...

103
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,700
you would see that this obviously
has 'Lorelai' written all over it.

104
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,036
- Fine. We'll get rid of it at next year's sale.
- Thank you.

105
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,207
- You guys are gonna love me.
- We already love you.

106
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,085
- No, I mean you're gonna really love me.
- We do.

107
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,296
Trust me, you guys are gonna so love me.

108
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,256
The love is starting to fade now.

109
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,759
I have here in my hand,
as requested by Ms. Lorelai Gilmore...

110
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:47,431
four fabulous tickets to The Bangles
at the Pastorella theater on Saturday.

111
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,224
- What?
- No!

112
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,101
- You love me?
- Baby, do I.

113
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,437
- These look like good seats.
- Ninth row, aisle.

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,440
I can't believe you got me my tickets.
How did you score these?

115
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,525
- Remember the Birnbaum wedding?
- Fiji Fantasy?

116
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,903
Yes. They were so thrilled
with the volcano cake...

117
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,738
they wanted to do something nice for me.

118
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,408
Since Mr. Birnbaum runs a ticket agency,
and I knew you were dying to go...

119
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,328
- so I asked him if he could...
- Make four girls very happy.

120
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,289
- Yeah, and he did.
- Huzzah for the Birnbaums!

121
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,792
Sookie, if you got four tickets,
and you and mom go...

122
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,377
then that means...

123
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,421
One for you and one for Lane.

124
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,173
Chickadee!

125
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:25,135
This is gonna be a very special night.
You know what a special night deserves?

126
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,303
What?

127
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,889
- A new outfit.
- Mom.

128
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,098
- Yes.
- No.

129
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,600
What could the problem be?

130
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:37,231
As I mentioned yesterday,
we will be holding a debate next week.

131
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,693
Your subject:
Did Charles I receive a fair trial?

132
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,238
The pros will represent the Parliament...

133
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,781
who deemed they had sovereignty.

134
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,783
The cons will represent the monarch...

135
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,161
and try and prove
that the charge against him was not legal.

136
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,914
What is fascinating, Mr. Dugray?

137
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,960
Nothing, Ms. Caldecott.

138
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,545
Nothing, Mr. Dugray?

139
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,590
My notes are fascinating, Ms. Caldecott.

140
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:06,134
Yes, they are fascinating, Mr. Dugray.

141
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,636
As I was saying...

142
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:11,014
the pro and con teams will each
have two minutes and thirty seconds...

143
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,976
for introductions, six minutes to debate...

144
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,853
three minutes for conclusions...

145
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,480
and five minutes for questions
from the audience.

146
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,359
The winner shall be decided
by a hand count from the rest of the class.

147
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,028
Does that sound like fun, Mr. Dugray?

148
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,116
- What?
- The debate. Does it sound like fun?

149
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,036
- Yes, it does.
- It does, doesn't it, Mr. Dugray?

150
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,289
It absolutely does, Ms. Caldecott.

151
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,208
More fun than staring
at Ms. Gilmore's ear?

152
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,713
- Yes, Ms. Caldecott.
- I think so, too.

153
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,592
Okay. Any questions?
Good. I'll assign your teams.

154
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,220
You, you, you, and you, con.

155
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,640
You, you, you, and you, pro.

156
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:57,477
- Who did she point to?
- Well, I think she...

157
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:58,937
You, you, you...

158
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,231
- Excuse me, Ms. Caldecott.
- Ms. Geller?

159
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,817
I wasn't sure who you pointed to just now.

160
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,779
Let's see. You, Ms. Lynn,
Ms. Grant, and Ms. Gilmore.

161
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,617
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am, but thank you for asking.

162
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,203
Okay, you...

163
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,331
you, you, and you, pro.

164
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,541
You and you, con.

165
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,296
- So I guess we should make a plan.
- To do what?

166
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,465
To work out our debate, Madeline.

167
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,675
- Yeah, right.
- We need a place to work.

168
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,219
- My house is out.
- Why?

169
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,429
- Because it is.
- We need a reason.

170
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,681
My mother is having
the entire place redone.

171
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,892
She wants all evidence of my father
out of there.

172
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,894
So unless you want to sit on no furniture...

173
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,022
and watch Harvey Fierstein
impersonators rip up the carpet...

174
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,650
paint everything white
and call it 'Angel's Kiss'...

175
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,236
then we're going to have to find
somebody else's house.

176
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,822
- My brother has the measles.
- My mom's having an affair.

177
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,410
I guess we could go to my house.

178
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,747
We're having a town rummage sale,
so it's kind of a mess...

179
00:08:58,789 --> 00:08:59,915
but it's there.

180
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,500
Isn't your house kind of far?

181
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,170
- It's 30 minutes away by bus.
- Bus? I don't do bus.

182
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,757
- Lf you have a better suggestion...
- l'll drive.

183
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,260
- Okay. So then, tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

184
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,553
Fine.

185
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,848
- Hey, Paris.
- Tristan, hi.

186
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,100
I was really hoping
we'd be in the same group.

187
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,726
- You were?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,272
We'd make the long hours of studying
go by a lot faster.

189
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:27,276
Plus, you and me on the same team.
We'd wipe the floor with the others.

190
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,279
I guess we'll just have to pair up
on something else then, huh?

191
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,781
- That would be good.
- Yeah, it would.

192
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:36,201
I'll see you later.
Bye, Madeline. Bye, Louise.

193
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:40,122
Tristan suddenly has very big eyes
for you, Grandma.

194
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,499
- Lucky.
- Stop it. He's just being nice.

195
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,710
- He should be so nice to me.
- And me.

196
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,753
We need to get to class.

197
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,969
- Tomorrow.
- Wow.

198
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,971
- Yep.
- All three of them?

199
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:58,348
'Double, double, toil and trouble.'

200
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:00,475
It should make
for an interesting afternoon.

201
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,645
'With the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes.'

202
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,981
- You're doing well in Shakespeare class?
- Not bad.

203
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,566
- Good.
- Thanks.

204
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,859
So what's the plan?

205
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,154
We'll ask if I can go to a play
tomorrow night with you and Lorelai.

206
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:14,281
- A play?
- I think that's the safest word.

207
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,074
'Show' or 'concert' would be very bad.

208
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,536
- What about saying it's a movie?
- Too far from the truth, almost a lie.

209
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,996
But a play's not a lie?

210
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,415
It's far enough from the truth
that it might work...

211
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:24,958
but close enough to the truth...

212
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:28,170
that I think I could negotiate
a purgatory stint, if forced to.

213
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,672
- Play it is.
- Okay. We're going in.

214
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,219
- Are you sure it's an original Queen Anne?
- Yes, original.

215
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:37,095
- The joints look wrong.
- Joints are fine.

216
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,806
- They look new.
- Nothing's new. Whole store is old.

217
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,893
Do you have a certificate or a letter
saying that it's old?

218
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,312
- Yes, l'll write a letter.
- Okay.

219
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:48,315
I guess if it's really old, l'll take it.

220
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,651
We appreciate your business.

221
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,487
She just made a sale. Now's a good time.

222
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:54,905
Hi, Mama.

223
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,156
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

224
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,407
- You look flushed.
- I do?

225
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,660
You ate candy, doughnut,
or Hostess fruit pie?

226
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,869
No, nothing. I'm fine.

227
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,287
- Hello, Mrs. Kim.
- Rory.

228
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,498
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- I'm busy.

229
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,793
I know. Could I could go somewhere
tomorrow with Rory and her mom?

230
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,837
- Tomorrow's church.
- This would be after that.

231
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,214
After church we think about
what we heard in church.

232
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,342
I could think about what I heard in church
on the way to the show.

233
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,677
- Show?
- Play.

234
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,971
Not show, play. It's a play, Mama.

235
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,765
Tell me about this play. What's it about?

236
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,519
It's about a group of people
who own instruments...

237
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,522
and stand in front of other people,
holding them.

238
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,358
- What?
- I'm not sure what it's about.

239
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,361
- We could find out.
- You find out, then we talk.

240
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:37,531
Excuse me. I'd really like that letter,
if you don't mind.

241
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,157
Yes, l'm coming.

242
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,371
How's that purgatory negotiation looking?

243
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,664
Not good.

244
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,542
- What do we do now?
- I'll ask again later.

245
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,879
- Call me if you need anything.
- Thanks. I will.

246
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,619
If you want coffee, you'll have to wait.

247
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,205
Someone put a sign for the rummage sale
on your window.

248
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,165
You can have decaf now
if you're in a hurry.

249
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,791
You should call the cops about this.

250
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,669
We know how you feel
about public displays of town affection.

251
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,755
Your mom asked me to put it there, okay?

252
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,299
- And you said yes?
- She's not real good with no.

253
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,634
No, she's not.

254
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,471
Every second you laugh at me
is one second longer you wait for coffee.

255
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,306
Sorry. No laughing.

256
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,233
Margaret Atworthy dropped off
three boxes of City Council potholders...

257
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:57,945
and begged me to take her grandson.
People are getting crazy, man.

258
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,907
- What?
- What are you wearing?

259
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,825
We've already argued
about the sweatshirt.

260
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,078
Yes, but we have not argued
about the hat.

261
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,163
- What hat?
- The one on your head, Annie Oakley.

262
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,289
Great, isn't it?

263
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,167
It's nice you're trying
to single-handedly rebuild a bridge...

264
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,294
but stop buying other people's junk.

265
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,964
Money goes to charity.
I look cute. Case closed.

266
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,590
Finally, the coffee cavalry arrives.

267
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,759
- What do you think you're wearing?
- A hat.

268
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,302
- Take that off.
- What?

269
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:25,013
- That is not yours. Take it off.
- But l'll have hat hair.

270
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,182
- I'm talking about the sweatshirt.
- Calm down.

271
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,600
That is not yours.

272
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,103
No, I found it in the bags of stuff
for the sale.

273
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,647
So you just find something
and take it? Is that it?

274
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,858
- No, I paid for it.
- So that makes it all right?

275
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,068
It makes it legal.
What is the matter with you?

276
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,987
- Nothing's the matter.
- Luke.

277
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,864
Pour your own coffee.

278
00:13:56,545 --> 00:14:00,007
Okay. Just a question.
Did anyone in town keep anything?

279
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,676
- Doesn't look like it.
- I'll never be civic-minded again.

280
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,511
You're doing a good thing.

281
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,513
- Sookie?
- I'm okay.

282
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,349
- Wave an arm.
- Here.

283
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,143
I got you.

284
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,980
Hold on. Something down here likes me.

285
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,233
I'm good. Hold on. Up, please.

286
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,153
Jeez, this stuff is like Tribbles.

287
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,738
Thank God, just in time.

288
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,948
Grab a bag
and move it to this side of the room.

289
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,117
Be very careful.
This pile tried to eat Sookie.

290
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,495
Maybe I should sic it on Paris
when she gets here.

291
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,705
God, that's right.
You're studying here today.

292
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,666
- Any minute, actually.
- This place is such a pit.

293
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,001
Don't worry about it.

294
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,462
They'll come in, make a face,
say something snotty...

295
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,796
we'll study, they'll leave.

296
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,090
I'm looking forward
to this whole day being over.

297
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,551
- Then I can concentrate on the concert.
- Yeah.

298
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,929
Lorelai, sweetheart,
would you come outside, please?

299
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,515
I want to know
where you want me to put these.

300
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,058
Coming, Patty.

301
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,936
Two very large porcelain squirrels.

302
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,480
- Set them free.
- Will do.

303
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,030
Wow! These are great.

304
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,283
They'll really come in handy
when we organize...

305
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,786
that giant marching band
we've been talking about.

306
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,164
I danced on these drums
at the Copacabana...

307
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,041
in 1969.

308
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,377
- Wow.
- It was a great act.

309
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,172
- I wore bananas.
- Please tell me you have a picture of that.

310
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:26,426
A lot of memories happened
on these drums.

311
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,805
But I guess it's time to move on.

312
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,265
Yeah, sure.

313
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,642
Now you'll have room
for that enormous tuba...

314
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,435
you've had your eyes on.

315
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,273
Leave these here.

316
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,402
Yeah, you, too. Bye.

317
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,491
- That was Lane.
- What's the verdict?

318
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,494
She decided to be stupid
and tell her mother the truth...

319
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:55,789
that she wanted to go to a rock concert
with us tonight in New York.

320
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,040
Stupid.

321
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,710
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm making coffee.

322
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,337
This looks really familiar.

323
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:04,631
That's mine. I saw it first...

324
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,717
and then I bought it, so it's mine now.

325
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,427
Really? Who brought it in?

326
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,555
I think Luke did,
and judging by his very hostile reaction...

327
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,223
he wasn't done wearing it yet.

328
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,143
- Oh, my. I wonder if...
- What?

329
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,353
I bet this was Rachel's.

330
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,772
Oh, my God, Rachel's?

331
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,816
Rachel? Who's Rachel?

332
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,319
Rachel was Luke's very serious girlfriend.

333
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,614
- It does look like her.
- When did Luke have a girlfriend?

334
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,909
This must have been,
what, five, six years ago?

335
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,870
Did she break that man's heart.
It was terrible.

336
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,371
How did I not know about this?

337
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:40,042
Honey, you had an 11-year-old kid,
and you were just moving into this house.

338
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,503
Plus Rachel traveled a lot.
She was a photographer.

339
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,171
- Archaeologist.
- Really?

340
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,339
Or flight attendant.

341
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,508
I can't believe I never even heard about it.

342
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,842
At least, I think so.

343
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:51,887
Luke never talks about it.
No one else likes to talk about it...

344
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,182
'cause he could kill you with that coffeepot
if he wanted to.

345
00:16:56,517 --> 00:17:00,479
I never pictured Luke having a girlfriend
or a broken heart.

346
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,232
I would keep this hidden if I were you.

347
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,235
I've got to be going.
Trampoline class at 2:00.

348
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:07,861
- Bye, Patty.
- Bye-bye.

349
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,030
Thanks for the drums.

350
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,950
These all need to be mended.

351
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,701
- My room.
- Okay.

352
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,962
Rory, I think your friends are here.

353
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,634
She must be one great baby-sitter,
to earn enough money for that car.

354
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,761
Let's just get this over with.

355
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,681
Take heart, my dear.
Suffer today, party tonight.

356
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,643
- Hi.
- Hi.

357
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,145
Come on in.

358
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:50,195
- So did you guys find it okay?
- There's no sign on this street.

359
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,282
That's why I told you to turn right
at the big rooster statue.

360
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,243
- I thought you were kidding.
- No, we never kid about Monty.

361
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,412
- Monty?
- Monty, the rooster.

362
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,664
Monty the Magnificent.

363
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,958
- Everybody, this is my mom.
- Lorelai.

364
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,335
This is Louise, Madeline, and Paris.

365
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,172
Very good girl-group names.

366
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,719
Sorry about the house of horrors here.

367
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,430
Some crazy lady volunteered
to lead this charity thing.

368
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,600
We're trying to get her some help.
So make yourselves comfortable.

369
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,519
- Just yell when you guys want pizza.
- Okay.

370
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,316
So, do you guys want to work in here
or in the kitchen?

371
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,650
Whatever.

372
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:30,986
Okay.

373
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,076
Okay. So here's how it should go:

374
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,038
Madeline will do the introductions,
l'll handle the debate...

375
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:44,291
Rory will do the conclusion,
and Louise will take questions.

376
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,585
Why do you automatically
get to handle the debate?

377
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,337
Because l'm the most experienced at it.

378
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,215
Trust me, you want her to handle it.
She never gives up.

379
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:52,549
Le pit bull.

380
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:57,304
- So what is all this stuff?
- It's for a big town rummage sale.

381
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,056
- Like a charity thing?
- Yeah.

382
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,518
There's an old bridge falling apart,
and the town's trying to save it.

383
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,354
- Cool hat.
- Put that down. It's used.

384
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,856
- Vintage, dear.
- Filthy, darling.

385
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,860
There's a store near my therapist's office
who has the best vintage clothes.

386
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:14,571
I found an original Pucci top
for practically nothing.

387
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,281
Pucci is very big right now.

388
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,659
- Is this a Pucci?
- No, that's a Patty.

389
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,369
- A Patty?
- Miss Patty.

390
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,872
She's a dance teacher here.
These are some of her old costumes.

391
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,500
Here, Paris. Tristan might like this.

392
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,752
Can we just work, please?

393
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,047
I would love to have a boyfriend
that looked like Tristan.

394
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,049
Your boyfriend's no slouch either.

395
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:37,094
- No, he's not.
- Yes, 6'2' and feisty.

396
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,972
So how's it going?
Are you two still Joanie Loves Chachi?

397
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,516
- God, I hope not.
- You are still together, aren't you?

398
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,685
- We're still together.
- How long has it been?

399
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,812
- I don't know.
- You do, too.

400
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,523
- About a month.
- Lifers.

401
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,818
- Jeez.
- We have a debate to organize here...

402
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,405
and this conversation is veering towards
the subject of French kissing...

403
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:58,407
and glitter eye shadow: Trashy or trendy?

404
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,910
I have no intention of being humiliated
in front of the whole class...

405
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,413
because we had to study
in the middle of a carnival...

406
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,623
and you two couldn't
keep your eye on the prize.

407
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:09,251
I want to win and I am going to win.

408
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:17,092
So, how good of a kisser
is Paul Bunyan anyway?

409
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,145
Okay. Does anybody in town
have a peg leg?

410
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,607
- No.
- Hem these.

411
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:37,070
- So, tell me more about this Rachel.
- Why are you so curious?

412
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,199
Because everybody in town
knows everything about it...

413
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,993
- and I don't like to be out of the loop.
- It's old news.

414
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,953
Yes, but l'm fascinated. I mean...

415
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,372
I go to Luke's once a day.
Sometimes twice.

416
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:51,418
Three times if Michel's talked to a relative
and his accent's gotten thicker.

417
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:55,047
I feel I should know the whole story.
What happened? Where'd she go?

418
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,676
Rachel liked to move around a lot.
She was a very adventurous person.

419
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,721
She loved to climb things,
and fling herself off cliffs...

420
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,390
and dive into these really tiny lakes...

421
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:08,810
and ride big wild horses, and fly planes.

422
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,647
- So she was Wonder Woman.
- She was to Luke.

423
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,650
- I thought they were gonna get married.
- What happened?

424
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,569
The rumor is that Stars Hollow
was too small for her.

425
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,613
She wanted to live
somewhere more exciting.

426
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:20,781
But Luke didn't.

427
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,034
You know Luke. Lived here all his life.

428
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,328
He wouldn't even go away to college.

429
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,331
I think we're gonna have to bury him
in that diner.

430
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:31,834
- It's sad.
- Yeah.

431
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:36,129
Okay. I am done here.
I'm gonna stop by the Inn for a while.

432
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,174
Then l'm gonna go home
and change for the show tonight.

433
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:42,177
- We leave at 6:00.
- I will be here. Bye.

434
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,031
We'll need the actual quotes,
so learn them by heart.

435
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,366
What about using notecards?

436
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,869
Notecards look sloppy.
We will know our information.

437
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,663
- But the other teams will use notecards.
- And they'll lose.

438
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,875
- Bye, girls. Rory, see you tonight!
- Bye, Sookie.

439
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,168
What's tonight?

440
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,129
We have tickets to see The Bangles
at the Pastorella theater.

441
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,547
- In New York?
- Yeah.

442
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,257
Sounds potentially not boring.

443
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,467
It's gonna be great. The seats are amazing.

444
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,469
- Who are you going with?
- My mom and Sookie.

445
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,013
- You're kidding.
- What?

446
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,724
- You're going to a concert with your mom?
- Yeah.

447
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:31,810
I cannot imagine doing anything like that
with my mom.

448
00:22:31,894 --> 00:22:33,729
We do stuff like this all the time.

449
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,272
- Really?
- Yeah.

450
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:38,442
- How old is your mom, anyway?
- Thirty-two.

451
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:39,568
Young.

452
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,528
That means she had you when she was...

453
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,031
She had her when she was 16.
We've done the math.

454
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,909
Can we 'ooh' and 'ah' about this quickly
and get to work?

455
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:50,329
- Sixteen. I'm sixteen.
- So am I.

456
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,332
We're all 16, okay.
Everybody in this room is 16.

457
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,417
- Paris is right. We should work.
- Thank you.

458
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:59,213
- I can't imagine having a baby at 16.
- Then keep your knees shut.

459
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:00,631
Very nice.

460
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,425
Do you think your mom is sorry
she got pregnant so young?

461
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,928
- Of course she is.
- Why, thank you.

462
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:09,598
- I didn't mean that. I just meant...
- I don't think she'd recommend it...

463
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:12,100
but I think she's happy
with how things turned out.

464
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:14,019
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

465
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:17,481
Okay. Just checking.
I'm starving. Is it pizza time yet?

466
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,066
- Are you guys hungry?
- I am.

467
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,734
- I can't eat dairy.
- Okay.

468
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,819
One with cheese, one without. Cokes?

469
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,780
- Yes, please.
- Me, too.

470
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:26,990
We're never going to finish.

471
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,576
I find your mother completely fascinating.

472
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,036
Funny. So does she.

473
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,456
- It's almost like having a big sister.
- And you like her, don't you?

474
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,960
- She's my best friend.
- Truly, completely fascinating.

475
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:41,088
- Rory, come in here a sec.
- I'll be right back.

476
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,803
How's it going in there?

477
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,639
- Truly, completely fascinating.
- Really?

478
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,808
We've basically gotten
no work done at all.

479
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,143
Paris is having a meltdown,
which is always fun.

480
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,270
Sounds it.

481
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:59,314
And, I don't know, we've just been talking.

482
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,817
I think you're actually making
some friends here.

483
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:03,318
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

484
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,738
They've just moved off the plan
to dump the pig's blood on me at prom.

485
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:10,242
Talking, chatting, no work being done.
There's friend potential going on.

486
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,661
Maybe. With Louise and Madeline,
at least.

487
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:16,081
Two out of three
formerly psychotic enemies. Not bad.

488
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:20,085
There. Pop-Tart appetizers to tide you over
until the pizza comes.

489
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:21,336
Thanks.

490
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,174
Hey, I have kind of a crazy idea.

491
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,426
That's never comforting, coming from you.

492
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,219
- Consider this, okay?
- Okay.

493
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:32,181
- We have four tickets to the show tonight.
- Yes, we do.

494
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:35,017
- What if I give them to you?
- What are you talking about?

495
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:38,854
Seems like you guys have a bonding thing
going on in there. It might be fun.

496
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,273
- What about you?
- You and I have bonded already.

497
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,276
If we bond any further,
we'll be permanently fused together.

498
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,945
You've talked about the concert
since you heard about it.

499
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:48,780
- I can still go.
- How?

500
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:50,991
Sookie and I can buy cheap seats there.

501
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,368
These tickets are ninth row, aisle.
Dream seats.

502
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,870
You don't have to do this.

503
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:57,206
But you have three years
of Chilton ahead...

504
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:00,209
and it'll be nice to have friendly people
to talk to there.

505
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,878
You seem to be getting along.
It might be good.

506
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:06,882
I totally don't mind. I just wanna see
the show. I don't care from what seat.

507
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,259
- Are you sure?
- Completely sure.

508
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,637
- Because l...
- Ladies!

509
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,184
- What are you guys doing tonight?
- Why?

510
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,604
We have these really great tickets
to see The Bangles...

511
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,731
and Rory thought you might like to come.

512
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,316
- Are you serious?
- No way.

513
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,193
Yeah, I mean, if you guys want to.

514
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:28,278
- I would love to go.
- Count me in.

515
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,948
- Paris, what about you?
- I can't.

516
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,408
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

517
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:36,578
- Because you're busy doing what?
- I have homework.

518
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:37,788
She'll be there.

519
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,331
- Good.
- Great.

520
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,062
- He made it.
- Oh, he's handy. How great.

521
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,605
You wear it all the time?

522
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,024
- Just when she's breathing.
- It's a love thing.

523
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:08,986
- Thanks for the contribution.
- Okay, here.

524
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,614
With these tickets,
you're about to enter sacred space.

525
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:16,785
You will be treading on hallowed ground.
You will be walking like an Egyptian.

526
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,203
- Mom.
- Take them.

527
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:21,039
You're gonna have a great time.
The Bangles are the best!

528
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:24,668
They were my favorite group in
high school. I almost named you Susanna.

529
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,462
The day I found out
you had no musical talent at all...

530
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,590
- was the saddest day of my life.
- Sorry.

531
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,593
You say that now. Here. Okay.

532
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,970
These are probably located...

533
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,638
Hi.

534
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:38,682
Can you tell me where these seats are?

535
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:41,602
- Those are right in here.
- Oh, good. Girls.

536
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,230
Here's the deal.
Take your tickets, go to your seats.

537
00:26:45,314 --> 00:26:47,649
Have the night of a lifetime. Bangle it up.

538
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:51,695
The second the concert is over,
meet us in front of the theater. Got it?

539
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:53,488
- Yes.
- Good. Now go!

540
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,577
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

541
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:03,916
- Okay. Let's go make our noses bleed.
- After you.

542
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,755
- Which aisle is it?
- We're almost there.

543
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,174
I have never sat this close
to a stage before.

544
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,384
I've never really been to a concert before.

545
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,638
So I could be sitting in the back
and say the same thing.

546
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,431
- In here.
- Good.

547
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,648
Wow. These are amazing seats.

548
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,067
Yes, they are.

549
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,987
- What are they looking at?
- One guess.

550
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,491
Check it out, we've got fans.

551
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,828
- Was I right?
- You were right.

552
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:46,041
And before it's dark, they'll have every
picnic basket that's in Jellystone Park.

553
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,548
- Did you ever see Everest?
- No.

554
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,091
It's a good movie.

555
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:57,469
We must be getting close.
We're running out of rows.

556
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,513
And 1,000.

557
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,016
- Okay. We're here.
- Great.

558
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,067
Okay. This is fine.

559
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:14,403
Yep. Not bad at all.

560
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:17,281
What?

561
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,786
What is so funny?

562
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,248
These are the worst seats
in the entire world.

563
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:31,378
- They are, aren't they?
- Oh, my God! It's so funny.

564
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:34,840
- Don't you think this is funny?
- You know, I don't.

565
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:39,428
I'm sorry.

566
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,896
They're starting! Do you have a lighter?

567
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,277
You mean a flamethrower. Get it?

568
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,779
A flamethrower, 'cause it's so far.

569
00:28:57,863 --> 00:29:00,282
Ladies and gentlemen, The Bangles!

570
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:58,358
- Was Rachel pretty?
- What?

571
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:01,904
- I'm just curious. Was she pretty?
- She was pretty.

572
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:07,075
- What kind of pretty?
- What do you mean?

573
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:10,245
Was she a Catherine Zeta-Jones
kind of pretty...

574
00:31:10,329 --> 00:31:12,372
or a Michelle Pfeiffery pretty, or...

575
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,875
She was an Elle MacPherson
kind of pretty.

576
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,418
- Really?
- Yep.

577
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:20,839
- That's an intense kind of pretty.
- You're not kidding.

578
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,843
I never pictured Luke
with an Elle MacPherson kind of pretty.

579
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:28,931
No? Pictured him more
with a Lorelai Gilmore kind of pretty?

580
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:33,644
The air up here must be very thin,
because you're delirious.

581
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,646
- And you're jealous.
- What?

582
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:38,857
- You're jealous of Rachel.
- You're accusing me of being jealous...

583
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:42,528
of a woman who dumped a man
l'm not even interested in five years ago?

584
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,446
- Yes.
- You don't think that's crazy?

585
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:47,699
- I do think that's crazy.
- Right, l'm not jealous.

586
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,243
Yeah, you are.

587
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:05,050
Oh, my God! He is so gorgeous.

588
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:06,760
I guess.

589
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,638
There's a massive party going on
right around the corner.

590
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,139
- So?
- So they invited us.

591
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,474
- Who?
- Jess and Sean.

592
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,810
We've been talking to them.
They're extremely cool.

593
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:16,311
- Are we going?
- Going where?

594
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:17,813
To the party.

595
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:20,232
- There's a concert going on.
- The band won't miss us.

596
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:23,151
- We can't just leave, Louise.
- It's America, Rory.

597
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:26,071
- We have to meet my mom after the show.
- Oh, come on.

598
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:27,865
What do you mean, 'Oh, come on'?

599
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:30,242
We have to meet my mother
after the concert.

600
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,411
The band may not miss us,
but Lorelai sure will.

601
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:33,912
These guys are so cute.

602
00:32:33,996 --> 00:32:37,291
- Great, but we're not going anywhere.
- What, are you afraid?

603
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:40,294
Of going out into a strange city
with guys I don't know? Yeah.

604
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:41,837
- Please?
- No!

605
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,840
- Well, we're going.
- No, you're not.

606
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,343
- Paris? Join, please?
- No, thanks.

607
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:51,388
Fine. Come on, Madeline.

608
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,308
And just what am I supposed
to tell my mother?

609
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,977
That you're a very good little girl.

610
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:05,194
The party's in a building on the corner
of Waverly and First. Try to get away.

611
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,489
We'll be back
by the time the concert's over.

612
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:15,579
You know, I really like this band.

613
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,966
- Well?
- I couldn't find Mom or Sookie anywhere.

614
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:29,843
So what do we do now?

615
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,679
I guess we just wait here
for them to find us.

616
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:34,097
Okay.

617
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,893
I can't believe Louise and Madeline
would just leave like that.

618
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:40,062
- They've done it before.
- Nice.

619
00:33:40,145 --> 00:33:41,522
Yeah, well.

620
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,569
- Can I ask you a question?
- Maybe.

621
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:52,199
- What could you possibly see in Tristan?
- You wouldn't understand.

622
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,618
- Is it just that he's cute?
- Partly.

623
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,120
'Cause there are a lot of cute guys
in the world.

624
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,831
Not like Tristan.

625
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:02,084
- He's just such a jerk.
- He's not always a jerk.

626
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,669
- No?
- No.

627
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,170
Okay.

628
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,714
When is he not a jerk?

629
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:10,092
I've known Tristan a really long time.

630
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,594
We've been in the same class
since kindergarten.

631
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,137
- Really?
- Yes.

632
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:19,101
And, well,
he has things in his life that are hard.

633
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:21,436
His parents, not so great.

634
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:24,314
- We have that in common.
- Okay.

635
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:27,901
- He kissed me once.
- He did?

636
00:34:28,277 --> 00:34:31,738
- Sixth grade. On a dare.
- How romantic.

637
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,866
You just don't know him like I do.

638
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:38,287
Okay, I believe you.
I just think maybe you could do better.

639
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:42,291
I know he's flirting with me to get to you...

640
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:44,585
but at least he's flirting with me.

641
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,545
- Hey.
- There you are.

642
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,881
Think fast. T-shirts for all the girls...

643
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:52,134
because l'm the Good Witch...
Aren't you missing a couple of kids?

644
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,927
- They left.
- Excuse me?

645
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,722
- Madeline and Louise met these guys...
- What guys?

646
00:34:56,805 --> 00:34:59,892
They were sitting behind us,
and they were having a party.

647
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:01,768
- Unbelievable!
- What's going on?

648
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,270
- They left.
- What?

649
00:35:03,312 --> 00:35:05,314
Let's go. Come on. Move!

650
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,824
If I leave the house with four girls,
l'm coming home with four girls.

651
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:19,661
Hi. I'm looking
for a couple of college boys...

652
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,788
who might live here or have friends here.

653
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,666
I don't talk to anybody. People annoy me.

654
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,631
- What?
- She found him with the blonde again.

655
00:35:32,758 --> 00:35:35,260
She's gonna knock on every door
in the entire building?

656
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:36,678
- Yep.
- Wow.

657
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:41,141
Hello! Is anyone home?

658
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:44,978
Hello!

659
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:49,358
Let's go follow your mother.

660
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:53,237
I wonder, if I was missing,
if my mom would come looking for me.

661
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,990
- Paris, you know she would.
- Yeah, or at least she'd send somebody.

662
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,373
- Music.
- Let's go.

663
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:13,799
That's one of the guys.

664
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:16,009
- Yeah?
- Hi. Could you move, please?

665
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:17,886
- What?
- Thanks.

666
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:21,098
Did you miss me?

667
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,474
- Lorelai.
- Ms. Gilmore.

668
00:36:22,558 --> 00:36:24,893
- Put the cups down. Let's move.
- Is there a problem?

669
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:28,939
Yeah. See those two idiots over there?
They're 16, underage. I bet you're not.

670
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:32,067
I also bet those big fancy party cups
aren't holding lemonade.

671
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:36,613
You really want to end any conversation
with me now. So just step aside, Skippy.

672
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,867
Move your asses. Outside, now!

673
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:51,420
I won't even begin to tell you
how completely insane it is...

674
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:55,424
to take off with strangers or drink things
that you don't know what's in them...

675
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,384
or act like you have a clue when you don't.

676
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:01,638
But if you ever pull a stunt like this again,
it will not be around my kid!

677
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:03,640
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

678
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:06,727
Good. Now let's go.
I can't wait to meet your parents.

679
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:11,064
We have some catching up to do.
I think we'll just talk all night long.

680
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:17,821
You know what?
I think this is the best night l've ever had.

681
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:28,916
I cannot believe I missed it.

682
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:31,460
- The concert was amazing.
- Forget about the concert.

683
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:34,546
I wanted to see Lorelai pull those idiots
out of that apartment.

684
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,423
It definitely was a Kodak moment.

685
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,551
- You didn't wake me up.
- I set the clock.

686
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:42,513
But the clock stops ringing
once I throw it against the wall...

687
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,473
giving me ample time to fall back to sleep.

688
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:47,684
You, however, never stop yapping
no matter how hard I throw you...

689
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,853
thus ensuring the whole wake-up process.

690
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:52,439
- I'm gonna get a soda. Want anything?
- Gum.

691
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,608
The night of my fourteenth birthday back...

692
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,487
so I could right the
green hot pant-roller disco outfit wrong.

693
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,447
- Coming right up.
- Bye.

694
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:04,827
So, talk to anybody today?

695
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,204
- You mean Madeline or Louise or Paris?
- Yes.

696
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,413
- No.
- Right.

697
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:10,624
But I bet school tomorrow
will be interesting.

698
00:38:10,707 --> 00:38:14,545
Oh, yes. Stories of Rory's crazy,
Bangles-obsessed mother...

699
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:18,006
ripping open apartment doors,
scaring the pointy-haired boys.

700
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,633
Totally uncool, man.

701
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,636
I had to do it, Rory.
They could have gotten hurt.

702
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:23,887
I know.

703
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:28,183
I thought inviting those girls out
would make it easier for you at school.

704
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:31,270
I've always thought 'easy'
is completely overrated.

705
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:32,688
That's my twisted girl.

706
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:35,649
Plus Paris decided
to let me split the debate time with her.

707
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:38,485
Wow! Wait, why am I wowing?

708
00:38:38,527 --> 00:38:41,280
Because splitting debate time with her
is like doing...

709
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:44,491
that spitting-in-your-palm
and-shaking-hands friendship oath thing.

710
00:38:44,575 --> 00:38:47,327
But way less gross. Good, l'm glad then.

711
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,622
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

712
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:57,629
Find anything good?

713
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:01,049
Yeah. I got some refrigerator magnets
shaped like sushi for a nickel.

714
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,302
- So basically I scored.
- Good.

715
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,763
- About what happened the other day...
- Forget it.

716
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,349
- I was a jerk. I didn't mean it.
- I know. Really.

717
00:39:09,391 --> 00:39:11,310
Yeah, well, I am sorry.

718
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:15,022
- I wanted to give this back to you.
- No. You bought it.

719
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:18,525
- I know, but it's yours, and I didn't know.
- Didn't know?

720
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,319
About the former owner.

721
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:22,863
If I had, I wouldn't have flaunted it
in front of you.

722
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:25,282
It's no big deal.
I was having a bad day, that's it.

723
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,743
Now I got magnetic sushi.
AIl's right with the world.

724
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:30,120
Okay, good. So here.

725
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,166
It obviously means something to you.

726
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,627
But you have to let things go
eventually, right?

727
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,796
But sometimes you need
a little something to remind you.

728
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,508
You wouldn't want to forget everything,
would you?

729
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:46,011
No, there was some stuff
I definitely would not want to forget.

730
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:48,263
So here, so you don't forget.

731
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:51,266
Thanks. Can I pay you for it?

732
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:54,937
- In coffee, absolutely.
- All right.

733
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:01,068
- I'm not pining.
- I know.

734
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,736
- Just remembering.
- Got it.

735
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,197
- Remembering is not pining.
- Absolutely right.

736
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,451
- It's a memento, like restaurant matches.
- I can see the resemblance.

737
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,370
Okay. Good.

738
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:13,080
- Bye, Luke.
- Bye.

739
00:40:14,305 --> 00:41:14,587
